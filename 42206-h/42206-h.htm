<h1 title="">The Camp Fire Girls
<br />at the End of the Trail</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">A Strange Background</span></span></h2>
<p>The castle had been built before the
first known palace in Europe. It
was fashioned centuries ago inside
the walls of a stone cliff with two taller cliffs
rising on either side. Beyond was a break
between, allowing a narrow entrance to
the cliff dwelling from the outside. In
front there was a small plateau of rock
ending in a precipice, which descended
with a drop of a hundred feet to a new
ledge, and then came another still deeper
fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>That afternoon a group of four persons
were inside the ancient cliff dwelling. One
of them&mdash;a young girl in an odd costume
which was partly modern and yet suggesting
an older race&mdash;had climbed to the crest of
the ruins and stood, with her hand above
her eyes, gazing about her.</p>
<p>Another girl, in a chamber below, was
sitting upon a comfortable camp stool which
she had undoubtedly brought with her,
she was hammering industriously with a
small steel hammer, and now and then
stopped to work with her chisel at a solid
stone wall. Evidently she believed some
extraordinary treasure was embedded inside,
since she never glanced away from her
labors.</p>
<p>On the bottom floor historic influences
had not kept the two remaining girls from
the cheering occupation of preparing tea.
The wood must have been brought from
the country behind the cliffs, for a camp
fire was burning in the old stone chamber,
with a large kettle of water simmering
above it.</p>
<p>One of the two girls&mdash;tall and foreign
in appearance, with large dark eyes and
thick dark hair parted in the middle over
a low brow&mdash;left her task now and then.
She would then walk twenty yards or more
toward a figure lying quietly in the sunshine.
In spite of the warmth this figure
was wrapped in a great blanket which
allowed only a fair head and thin face to
show forth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>If no attention was vouchsafed her, she
would quietly return to her occupation.
But, by and by, without speaking, she
came and spread a small cloth on a flat
surface of rock. Then she unpacked an
Indian basket stored with things for making
tea. Immediately afterwards, putting her
fingers to her lips, she summoned the other
girls to join her.</p>
<p>In response Alice Ashton rose up at once
and carefully stored away her precious bits
of stone and her hammer and chisel into
the bag she carried for the purpose. Then
she climbed down the jagged but secure
steps cut into the face of the rock so many
years ago.</p>
<p>But Peggy Webster, at the summit of the
cliff dwelling, refused to descend in any
such sensible fashion.</p>
<p>Instead, she began to slide over the face
of the rock, losing and then regaining her
foothold. Below the others watched her
half fascinated and half annoyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy!&rdquo; one of the girls called
warningly.</p>
<p>For Vera Lageloff had seen her safely
reach a flat surface about ten feet from the
plateau below. She had walked out to
the edge of it and there stood poised for a
moment with her back to the sun. Her
pose was as virile and graceful as that of a
young boy.</p>
<p>Then, before the watchers exactly realized
her purpose, she had crouched and sprung
from the ledge. For the instant she was
in the air she was a figure of bronze and
crimson. The moment had struck the
earth, she was merely Peggy Webster, in a
khaki Camp Fire costume with a red band
about her black hair and a little out of
breath from her plunge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There I have been wondering if I could
accomplish that feat ever since I arrived
in this stone age country,&rdquo; she announced
penitently, appearing more ashamed of her
performance than proud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as long as you are gratified and
still alive, Peggy, I only request that you
never make the same attempt again,&rdquo; Betty
Graham returned, her color returning
swiftly, now that her momentary nervousness
had passed. For she had come away
from her task of guarding the fire just in
time to behold the other girl&rsquo;s act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, since we came West, Peggy dear,
I am becoming more and more convinced
that the Fates never intended you for a
feminine person,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;There is
never any guessing what reckless thing
you may do next. I am afraid an accident
may happen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was speaking, Bettina Graham
had taken her seat on the ground and had
begun pouring the hot water into a tea-kettle
of generous size.</p>
<p>Peggy now dropped down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I am masculine, please, Bettina;
I do so hate a masculine woman. Your
last remark was only a more polite way of
expressing the same unpleasant idea. Why
don&rsquo;t you say instead that I am &lsquo;Seraphita?&rsquo;
She is Balzac&rsquo;s charming character&mdash;half
girl, half boy, neither and both. When I
am in favor with Tante she has a way of
declaring me another Seraphita.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Besides your sudden plunge might have
frightened Billy,&rdquo; Vera Lageloff interrupted,
not realizing how her speech
betrayed the interest usually uppermost
in her mind.</p>
<p>The figure, still wrapped in the blanket,
was at present sitting up, looking from one
girl to the other in a quietly disinterested
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I am never worried over Peggy
when she is attempting athletic feats,&rdquo;
he announced. &ldquo;She will never do herself
serious harm in that way. What I fear for
her, what I know will hurt her some day, are
the experiences about which she is so
scornful at present. You see she is perfectly
convinced that she will never care
for any human being outside her family and
a few friends. So nothing and no one can
ever harm her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy Webster accepted the cup of tea and
a comfortable number of sandwiches which
Vera now offered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Billy,&rdquo; Peggy challenged,
her face reddening in spite of her
effects to appear undisturbed. &ldquo;As far as
you are concerned you will look ever so
much better as soon as you cease behaving
like an invalid. I do believe you are in
better health than you wish us to think you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am; really I don&rsquo;t exactly
know,&rdquo; Billy returned dispassionately, as
if he were speaking of some one else. He
was holding his cup and	gazing over its
rim. &ldquo;I do enjoy having so little asked
of me. It has never happened before, as I
have always been expected to do the things
I dislike. Now, I would far rather be half
ill than to have to shoot and fish and do the
kind of things Dan and the other fellows
out here like to do. Besides, I really tried
to make myself ill, so that father would
have to consent to my coming West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy made this announcement without
embarrassment, but not as if he cared
whether or not it were believed.</p>
<p>It was his sister, Peggy, who flushed
uncomfortably as she always did over her
brother&rsquo;s oddities. To her truthful mind
and straightforward nature his peculiarities
were impossible to understand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>But Billy did not look as if his words had
been altogether true. In spite of his sister&rsquo;s
speech, he was far more fragile than he had
been when she had said farewell to him
at their farm in New Hampshire a few
months before. She had then started west
to join her aunt, Mrs. Burton, and become
a member of the Sunrise Hill Camp Fire
club in Arizona.</p>
<p>At this instant and without being
observed, Vera shook her head at Peggy.</p>
<p>If no one else understood Billy Webster&rsquo;s
vagaries, the Russian girl with whom he had
so deep a friendship apparently did, or if
not she usually had an excuse for him.</p>
<p>But Peggy suddenly remembered that
her brother was not supposed to know how
ill he had been.</p>
<p>Then, almost at the same time, an interruption
followed in the form of an extraordinary
sound, or combination of sounds.
First there was the long-drawn-out wail of
annoyance and protest made by a small
western burro; then an intermingling
of faint shrieks of fear with gay laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Peggy and Bettina both ran forward to
the narrow opening between the two cliff
walls. Then they beheld an extremely
pretty, rather plump woman, with rose-colored
cheeks and grey in her brown hair,
riding astride a burro. The burro was
being lead by another woman of the same
age, extraordinarily like and yet unlike
the other one. The woman on foot was
more slender and paler, her hair was darker
and not grey, and her eyes a deeper blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy, darling, for goodness sake help
me get your mother off this beast,&rdquo; she called
out as soon as the two girls were inside
the defile, &ldquo;I have had to drag both the
animal and Mollie Webster every inch
of the way. See, Mollie, I told you that
our camp was not far from this old cliff
dwelling which the girls and I discovered
and adopted the other day. You might
easily have walked here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I might and would have, Polly
O&rsquo;Neill Burton, had I dreamed that you
were going to make this wretched animal
actually trot with me across a stone
wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During her protest, with some difficulty,
Mrs. Webster was being persuaded to dismount
from her burro by Peggy and Bettina.
But she seemed not to have acquired
the art of making the proper beginning, for
her too long and too full skirt kept getting
twisted around her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better wear a proper Camp Fire costume,
especially adapted for a Camp Fire
guardian at the Grand Canyon of Arizona,
Mollie,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton suggested, going
forward and leaving the girls to find some
place to fasten the burro, when finally her
beloved twin sister had made the descent
to earth in safety.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s costume was in fact charming
and so simple that one would not
easily have known how expensive it was.
She wore tan-colored, high kid boots,
wrinkling above the foot like mousquetaire
gloves, a khaki-colored broadcloth coat and
a short skirt with trousers of the same
material beneath. Her hat was of French
felt, a little deeper shade of brown, and
trimmed with a soft red scarf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy, you look like an Indian chief
with that blanket wrapped about you,
provided one does not look too carefully on
the inside,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Hope the
tea isn&rsquo;t all gone; your mother needs some
refreshment, although I don&rsquo;t care for any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then walking over to the edge of the cliff
Mrs. Burton stood looking down, with a
curious sensation of fascination and fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>A moment later Mrs. Webster sat down
beside her son, giving a suppressed sigh
of relief. Billy seemed so much better,
although he had been at the new Sunrise
Camp but little over a week.</p>
<p>A short time before the Sunrise Hill
Camp Fire party, who had been for several
months living in a group of tents on the
borders of the Painted Desert, had moved
on to the neighborhood of the Grand
Canyon. They were now in camp not far
from the famous Angel Trail.</p>
<p>But before they were fairly settled a
letter had arrived from Mrs. Webster
saying that she would like to join the
Camp Fire party and wished to bring
along her two sons, Dan and Billy Webster.</p>
<p>There was no possibility of declining to
welcome the newcomers, for it was Billy&rsquo;s
serious illness which had made a western
trip necessary and forced his father&rsquo;s consent
to their joining his aunt&rsquo;s camping
party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>However, the campers were extraordinarily
well pleased and particularly Polly
Burton. For if her beloved Mollie were
with her, surely her difficulties as Camp
Fire guardian were over. She and Mollie
were so unlike they were complements to
each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact is when we are together, Mollie
mine, we have all the virtues and leave none
to be desired,&rdquo; Polly O&rsquo;Neill, who was
now Mrs. Richard Burton, had more than
once announced to her twin sister.</p>
<p>And Mollie had laughed as she always
did, accepting the speech as only one of her
gifted sister&rsquo;s absurdities. For, in spite of
her Polly&rsquo;s genius, her opinions never made
much impression upon Mrs. Webster.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, perhaps on this point she
was not altogether wrong. Already, since
Mrs. Webster&rsquo;s coming, the group of Camp
Fire girls unconsciously were under the spell
of its truth. There were some to whom
Mollie Webster represented the influences
which they needed and desired. She was
far more motherly than her sister and
loved to fuss and worry over each girl&rsquo;s
health and appetite. Yet, in her gentler
fashion, she was really more exacting than
Mrs. Burton, as such apparently yielding
natures often are.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Already Alice Ashton and Vera Lageloff
felt more closely drawn to Mrs. Webster&mdash;Vera,
because she was Billy&rsquo;s mother and
had been her friend before she met Mrs.
Burton.</p>
<p>With Alice Ashton the circumstances
were different. For one thing, Alice felt
that her Aunt Mollie took her more seriously
and had a real respect for her intellectual
interests and abilities. She could not
always be perfectly certain that the other
Camp Fire guardian was not sometimes a
little amused by her ambitions.</p>
<p>Vera and Alice were both engaged in
serving Mrs. Webster with tea. A moment
later Bettina and Peggy walked over and
stood on either side of Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what on earth, Tante, did you
expect us to hitch that wretched beast?&rdquo;
Bettina demanded. &ldquo;Peggy did finally
manage to tie him to a cliff but it required
an extraordinary amount of talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing, Mrs. Burton slipped one hand
inside Peggy&rsquo;s and the other in Bettina&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, children, but I could not persuade
Mollie to come with me in any other
way and I did want her to see this wonderful
view. You know how she hates walking,
but perhaps we may get her into better
habits while she is in the West with us.
Look down there. The distance is tremendous,
isn&rsquo;t it? and yet this is only one
of the smaller canyons&mdash;not the Grand
Canyon. The roaring of the water sounds
as far beneath as if it were the River Styx.
But don&rsquo;t get so close to the edge, Bettina.
I thought looking down great heights made
you feel uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one jumped or fell over this cliff
the other day,&rdquo; Peggy announced. &ldquo;Ralph
Marshall told me that the man had been a
guest at the hotel where he is staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton shivered, drawing back in
her usual impressionable fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell us any gruesome details,
please, Peggy dear. Remember it is the
wonder and beauty of nature we must
think of, and not its terribleness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the woman and two girls
were silent for a little while, each pursuing
her own train of thought and each admiring
in her fashion the marvelous spectacle
before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>It was as if a sunset had been inverted
and its colors dropped down inside the
cliffs, using the stones for clouds to hold the
lights. Farther down, the walls of earth
grew dark and finally a black stream ran
between them.</p>
<p>A little later Mrs. Webster called to her
sister and the two girls to join her. They
then returned at once to the rest of the
group and for half an hour sat there laughing
and talking. For their background
they had one of the most ancient dwellings
of the human race ever found upon the
earth, and their foreground was a portion
of one of the great wonders of the world.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Camp Fire party talked
chiefly of their own affairs. After all,
human beings are seldom vitally interested
for long in anything save themselves and
their own kind.</p>
<p>But, by and by, Mrs. Burton arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please hurry, everybody, we must get
back to camp as soon as possible,&rdquo; she suggested.
&ldquo;We forget that now September
is here the days are getting shorter. I for
one have not the courage to be lost in this
part of the world. Moreover I have something
to tell you when we reach camp which
may surprise you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">White Roses</span></span></h2>
<p>The new camping site was by far the
most beautiful the Sunrise Camp
Fire club had ever occupied, even
bearing in mind all its former history.</p>
<p>With wagons and their burros the girls,
Mrs. Burton, and their guide had followed
a trail leading from the old site near the
Painted Desert to the new. They had
preferred the long trek, although the nearby
railroad would have covered the distance
in a few hours.</p>
<p>Yet in this part of the country how easy
it is to forget modern civilization if one will,
since half a century ago the Grand Canyon
itself was still unexplored.</p>
<p>Here their tents were pitched in a portion
of the world&rsquo;s garden, while only a short
distance away was the most gigantic wonder
in stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>In less than three-quarters of an hour the
little party of seven, who had been drinking
tea, arrived at their present home, involuntarily
stopping a few yards from the
tents for the purpose of enjoying the
picture before them. They had come
through half a mile of pine forest after
leaving the neighborhood of the cliffs and
now found themselves encircled by pines
on all sides. In only a few places was there
a clearing through which one could get a
vista of the far horizon, but in one of these
clearings the new Sunrise camp had pitched
their white tents.</p>
<p>In front of the tents the grass was soft and
thick and of a deep bluish green. To the
left a miniature hill was broken by a narrow
fissure down which a tiny, clear stream
trickled into a small lake below that was
only a little larger than a big circular mirror.
As a matter of course the pool had been
christened the &ldquo;Wishing Well.&rdquo; The name
is indeed time honored, but then wishing
is perhaps the oldest and at the same time
the youngest occupation in the world.</p>
<p>A few scrub trees and bushes grew along
the ground between the pines, yet the air
was altogether filled with the pine tang
and fragrance. In many nearby places
there were the brilliant early autumn
flowers of the western plateaus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>As a beacon light to the home-comers, as
well as for domestic reasons, a large fire
was burning at a safe distance from the
tents. Through the trees the sunset colors
turned the scene to rose and gold.</p>
<p>For the moment there chanced to be no
one in sight save Marie Papin, Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s
maid, and Mr. Jefferson Simpson, the
Camp Fire guide.</p>
<p>So near the fire were they standing and
so absorbed in their conversation that,
although they must have noticed the
return of the little party, neither turned
to speak to any one of them.</p>
<p>In the reflection of the firelight the two
figures made an interesting and not an
ordinary picture. The contrast between
them was striking. For once Marie had
discarded her conventional maid&rsquo;s costume
of black and was wearing a white muslin
dress as only a French woman can wear
white, changing it from simplicity to coquetry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Moreover, the rough-and-ready outdoor
costume, ordinarily adhered to by Mr.
Simpson, had been set aside for a conventional
attire, or possibly this was his
impression. Yet Mr. Simpson did not
appear conventional.</p>
<p>As they reached their own tents Polly
Burton nodded significantly to Peggy and
Bettina. Then she waited outside when
they disappeared inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Tante&rsquo;s surprise, which we
were to hear on our return, had anything
to do with Marie and Mr. Simpson?&rdquo;
Peggy demanded, as she began changing her
costume for the more ceremonial one worn
at dinner. She was looking reflective and
at the same time a little annoyed&mdash;an
expression characteristic of Peggy Webster
under some conditions. She did not enjoy
romantic problems.</p>
<p>Bettina laughed. She knew that Peggy
had an instinctive prejudice against the
romantic in any and all its forms. Not only
Bettina, but Peggy&rsquo;s family and many of
her friends often wondered why Peggy
should be so different in this from other
girls. Moreover, how would she ever meet
her own romance when her hour came, if
she had so intense a shyness at its very
suggestion among other people?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>A number of times Bettina had been
aware that their Camp Fire guide felt more
than an ordinary interest in Marie. Yet
the thought of an affair between the young
French woman with her ideas of life and
the big uncultured miner had seemed
impossible. They were farther apart than
the two poles, since, in the end, the poles
being reached bear many resemblances.
If Mr. Simpson had been rich, there might
have been another story. However, some
theory had to be worked out to explain Mr.
Simpson&rsquo;s wish to continue as the Sunrise
Camp Fire guide.</p>
<p>True, he was a soldier of fortune who,
according to his own story, had played
many parts. However, each member of
the Camp Fire club appreciated his superiority
to the task he had undertaken of
being their courier, guide, man of all work,
doing a hundred and one tasks for a group
of something less than a dozen women.
Even if he had fallen upon evil days and
accepted the work as a temporary occupation
or amusement&mdash;for he appeared to
consider his tasks more amusing than
laborious&mdash;there were many other more
dignified and lucrative occupations in which
he could have engaged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>So Bettina reflected, as she followed
Peggy&rsquo;s example in getting dressed.</p>
<p>They had not finished when a slim figure
slipped in to their tent uninvited.</p>
<p>Her expression was slightly apologetic as
she seated herself upon the edge of a cot,
drawing one foot up under her and flinging
her hat aside, as a girl frequently does
when beginning a confidence.</p>
<p>However, the newcomer was not a girl.
Instead she was the Camp Fire guardian
and hostess of the Sunrise club in Arizona
at the present time, and also in their
recent camping experience upon the edge
of the Painted Desert, Mrs. Richard Burton,
the famous actress, known to the public
as Polly O&rsquo;Neill Burton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry my surprise for this evening has
not developed, or rather that it has
developed in an unexpected fashion,&rdquo; she
began, speaking enigmatically and shrugging
her shoulders, half chagrined and
half pleased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you girls know from experience
that I am more nervous over playing
chaperon than any other Camp Fire guardian
duty. But I must confess I never
expected to be troubled by Marie! She
and I have traveled together for years
without Marie&rsquo;s having a single love affair
so far as I have been told. And then
appears Mr. Simpson, the last person to be
suspected in the light of a lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s lips twitched and her
eyes shone with an amused light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Mr. Simpson very much. Really
I am afraid Marie is not good enough for
him as she is behaving so absurdly,&rdquo; she
ended inconclusively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tante, what are you talking about?
Certainly you never betray your point
at the beginning of a story as so many
people do,&rdquo; Peggy demanded, still frowning,
but approaching nearer the lady on the
cot.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Peg, but, perhaps, remembering
your prejudice against love affairs, I forbore
to tell you several days ago that Marie
and Mr. Simpson became engaged on the
last night of our journey to camp. You
may recall that Mr. Simpson took a number
of you girls out for a walk after we had
pitched tents for the night and after Marie
had me safely stored away in bed. I was
surprised at the time at her wishing to go
with you, as Marie and outdoor exercise
are not enamored of each other. Then
Marie came in late, after you girls had gone
to bed, and told me her news. We were
planning to have a party tonight and
announce the engagement. I sent hundreds
of miles for a cake and white roses,&rdquo; Mrs.
Burton concluded mournfully.</p>
<p>Bettina Graham was twisting her yellow-brown
hair into a single braid about her
small head&mdash;a difficult performance before
a six-inch hand mirror which she held in
one hand while twisting with the other.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she inquired, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t the roses
arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton nodded. &ldquo;Oh yes, but
Marie has broken her engagement. Mr.
Simpson confided to me that he thinks it is
on account of his new clothes. He insists
that Marie thought he would look like one
of her Broadway heroes as soon as he discarded
his western outfit. Assuredly he
does not. Funny that he gave me this
information quite good-naturedly, with an
amused twinkle in his eyes! Of course
Marie declared this untrue. She now
announces that she could not make up her
mind to leave me; besides life in the West
could never satisfy her. She believes she
must have been unduly influenced by the
September moon at the time of her acceptance
of Mr. Simpson.&rdquo; Mrs. Burton shook
her head in reflection. &ldquo;The laws of
attraction between human beings are perhaps
the strangest of all laws. Remember
my oracular speech, children; you may find
it useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment she got up stiffly, as
persons do after sitting in an awkward
position for any length of time.</p>
<p>Peggy had continued frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How silly Marie is! I do think she
has behaved abominably. I simply can&rsquo;t
understand how people can be so &lsquo;changy&rsquo;
about serious matters,&rdquo; Peggy concluded,
her cheeks again coloring with annoyance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Remembering her own uncertainties on
this same subject and concerning the acceptance
of the husband whom she now adored,
Mrs. Burton suddenly felt less vexed with
Marie than she had a few moments before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All people are not alike, Peggy dear, for
which we should be thankful. Anyhow
there are at least two widely different
varieties, the &lsquo;Sentimental Tommies&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;Grizels&rsquo; of this world. One had a good
many minds inside of one mind and they
all have to be pleased. Then there are
fortunate people like you and Grizel dear,
who have only one beautiful clear mind to
make up without doubts and backslidings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I must depart to get ready for
dinner. At least we have the consolation
of the cake and the roses. Mr. Simpson
insists that he will appear at his engagement
party, even if there is no engagement and
no bride. But Marie, of course, has
retired in tears.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">A New Dawn</span></span></h2>
<p>Very rarely did Polly Burton arise
early in the morning. This excellent
habit she had never liked as a girl
and, of course, later on her stage life had
made the custom well nigh impossible.
Now, however, within the past few months
of outdoor camping, she had changed and
become that very doubtful early bird, or
early worm, for one never can be sure
which one may be&mdash;the winner of the
morning prize or the victim.</p>
<p>However, the coming of daylight in this
extraordinary land of hills and deserts, of
giant cliffs and fairy gardens, was worth a
serious effort.</p>
<p>At any rate this was Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s
impression. Frequently she used to slip
out of her tent before any one else had
awakened and watch the dawn above the
blue San Francisco peaks spread itself
slowly over the entire horizon. Afterwards
she sometimes returned to bed and to sleep,
or else read until the Camp Fire girls were
in evidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>This morning it was a little before six
o&rsquo;clock when, getting into her clothes, she
slipped out of doors. Quiet had to be
preserved for, now that Mrs. Webster had
arrived, she was sleeping in her sister&rsquo;s
tent, while another smaller tent had been put
up not far off which Dan and Billy Webster
were occupying together. Now, that Billy
was so much better, his brother was able
to look after him at night. Moreover
their mother, after her siege of nursing,
required the rest.</p>
<p>For two reasons, therefore, Mrs. Burton
departed without making the least disturbance.
First, she wished her sister to
continue sleeping, second, she did not wish
her own plan interfered with. One never
could be sure when Mollie would not take a
stand against what she might consider an
unnecessary eccentricity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s desire was to see the sun
rise above one of the canyons and to see it
alone. Not the Grand Canyon itself; one
still had a day&rsquo;s journey down a precipitous
trail from the Sunrise Hill camp for the
best view of this amazing spectacle. She
intended visiting one of the lesser canyons
which was within reasonable walking
distance.</p>
<p>The pine forest was as gloomy and quiet
as a dim old cathedral when Polly Burton
started swiftly through it toward the
neighborhood of the cliffs of the day before.</p>
<p>There was a mist at the top of the trees
hiding the first shafts of daylight. No
other living human being was about. Only
in one of the trees a screech owl, still under
the impression that it was night, continued
his curious wailing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton was not frightened, but
naturally she was a little nervous and
keenly alive to every sight and sound.
Always enjoying new emotions and new
impressions; now the early morning walk
alone in so strange a place was unlike any
past experience she could recall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Not many miles away stood a fashionable
hotel filled with tourists, who had come to
Arizona to see the Grand Canyon. Yet
here in the forest one appeared to be in
a primeval world. Not so different could
these forests have been in the prehistoric
days of the cliff dwellers, whose ancient
homes were in the nearby cliffs.</p>
<p>Following the trail Polly Burton kept
glancing from one side of the path to the
other. Ridiculous, of course, but all
through dinner the evening before Dan
Webster had been regaling the girls with
stories of the deer and bear supposed to
live in the adjacent woods.</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of her unfaith, there was
always enough of the spirit of the adventurer
in Mrs. Burton, left over from the one-time
Polly O&rsquo;Neill, to hope for the unexpected.</p>
<p>Once in a place where the trees grew
thicker than elsewhere, she half believed
she saw a big, brown figure go lumbering
off on all fours in the opposite direction.
Nevertheless, without being interrupted
in any way, she finally arrived at the ledge
of cliffs where she had spent the afternoon
before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Now, instead of stopping at the same
place, she walked slowly along, carefully
guarding each step. The morning light
was a dull grey&mdash;the color of deep shadows.
Slowly the sky was growing warmer and
breaking into light, coloring the thick mist
in the ravine below until it resembled a
mammoth, iridescent soap bubble.</p>
<p>Then the mist began to separate and to
float upward like an army of ghostly
figures.</p>
<p>The effect was fascinating&mdash;even thrilling&mdash;and
yet it was eery. To an imaginative
person many fantastic ideas would have
presented themselves. It was as if the
spirits of evil persons having been enchained
to do penance for their sins in the world
below, and now, having expiated their
misdeeds, were allowed to float upward.
Sometimes they moved in pairs, gradually
drifting apart as they reached the higher
air. Now and then a more lonely ghost,
appearing as if wrapped about in a cloak
of silver mist, would pursue his upward
flight alone.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton felt more than repaid for
her trip, yet regretted that she had not
brought one of the girls with her. Bettina
would perhaps have enjoyed the spectacle
most. The Camp Fire guardian was
beginning to understand Bettina Graham
better than she had in their past Camp
Fire experience. But her desire was not
purely unselfish, for she was nervous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>The scene was almost too beautiful and
mysterious to be witnessed by oneself.
Besides, in the past few months she had
grown so accustomed to being in the
society of the Sunrise Hill Camp Fire girls
that she was almost uncomfortable any
great length of time without them.</p>
<p>Now it would have been pleasant to have
heard Bettina&rsquo;s pretty fancies, or to have
had Peggy dispel the mists by a practical
suggestion, or to have listened to Alice&rsquo;s or
Ellen&rsquo;s scientific explanation of clouds, or to
have beheld Sally and Gerry giggling
irresponsibly over something which had
nothing to do with mists or ghosts or
canyons.</p>
<p>Yet Mrs. Burton lingered until the dawn
had fully come and all the sky was rose
crimson. Then, glancing at her watch,
she started toward camp.</p>
<p>In another half hour the girls would be up
and preparing breakfast. As no one knew
where she had disappeared it was possible
that her Sister Mollie might become uneasy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Once in the woods again she walked more
hurriedly, not only because she feared being
late, but for another more absurd reason.
Unexpectedly Mrs. Burton had the sensation
of being followed.</p>
<p>She did not see any one or anything, and
was not even sure that she heard distinctly.
Nevertheless her impression was
vivid.</p>
<p>Twice she stopped and waited; once she
called aloud; the second time, very like
the one-time Polly O&rsquo;Neill, she stamped her
foot, crying out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any one is playing a prank on me,
please understand that I am weary of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. However, afterwards
she had no longer the sensation of
being pursued.</p>
<p>At camp Sally Ashton and Gerry Williams
were busy preparing breakfast. Camp
life was at least eventful when these two
girls were at work.</p>
<p>Really, once stirred out of her slothfulness,
Sally Ashton, who was essentially
feminine, was an extraordinarily good cook.
However, she required several persons to
wait upon her while she was at work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>This morning, in honor of Mrs. Webster,
she was making a new cornmeal bread
from a recipe which the Indian girl, Dawapa,
had taught her.</p>
<p>She had Dan Webster engaged in assisting
her. Dan not only brought fresh wood for
her fire every few moments, but in between
his pilgrimages watched with anxiety the
cakes slowly browning in the hot ashes.
Sally was never content unless she had at
least one man or boy engaged in her active
service. As a matter of fact if one were
about she did not find this difficult to
accomplish.</p>
<p>She waved a plump little hand toward
their guardian when Mrs. Burton strolled
into camp. Over the great pan of bacon
she was frying Gerry Williams threw her a
kiss.</p>
<p>There was no one else about. A little
tired from her walk, Mrs. Burton sat down
a short distance from the fire, for the
warmth was pleasant, and, embracing her
knees, began rocking slowly back and forward
just as Polly O&rsquo;Neill had always done
when she wished to work out a problem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton was again considering her
group of Camp Fire girls. How pretty
Sally looked! Her hair lay in soft brown
curls over her white forehead. She did
not tan as the other girls. At the moment
her big brown eyes were shining with an
animation she did not always show. She
was wearing a big apron over her Camp
Fire dress.</p>
<p>Deliciously domestic Sally appeared to be
working out-of-doors! For, although Sally
did belong to the type of women whom we
choose to call especially feminine, she had
gone far beyond the history of the primitive
woman. Sally&rsquo;s idea was to enslave,
certainly not to be enslaved.</p>
<p>In appearance she and Gerry Williams
were a complete contrast, although having
many tastes in common.</p>
<p>Since the trouble between Gerry Williams
and Bettina Graham, Gerry and the Camp
Fire guardian had not continued such
devoted friends. Until then, except for her
niece, Peggy Webster, Gerry had undoubtedly
been Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s favorite among her
group of girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>But Gerry&rsquo;s effort to force Bettina to
remain behind in the Indian&rsquo;s house, in order
to place her in a false position during their
last camping experience, had appeared not
only mischievous but malicious. Mrs.
Burton wondered if she had been right in
bringing a girl of Gerry&rsquo;s training and tastes
to live with girls who had been brought up
so differently. She still said nothing to
any one of them concerning Gerry&rsquo;s history,
but she had one talk with the girl herself.
Afterwards Gerry apologised, both to Bettina
and to her and appeared to repent her
behavior.</p>
<p>Now, in spite of the fact that Mrs. Burton
could not trust her as she had at the
beginning of their friendship, nevertheless
Gerry&rsquo;s prettiness and affectionate manners
never failed to appeal to her. She returned
the kiss light-heartedly.</p>
<p>A few moments later the other Camp Fire
girls appeared.</p>
<p>Peggy took away her aunt&rsquo;s coat and hat,
since Marie had not been seen since the
night before. She was no longer sleeping
in Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s tent, but in a tent with
several of the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Alice Ashton reported to Mrs. Burton
that Marie had not yet lifted her head from
the pillow, so overcome did she appear to
be, either from relief or regret at the loss
of Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>Breakfast was about ready to serve
before Mrs. Webster and Billy finally came
out to join the others. They were an odd
contrast&mdash;the mother and son&mdash;suggesting
the homely but immortal comparison of
the hen with the ugly duckling.</p>
<p>Mrs. Webster&mdash;who had once been Molly
O&rsquo;Neill&mdash;had cheeks round and soft and
rosy as a girl&rsquo;s. Her blue eyes were filled
with the sweetness of a loving and unquestioning
nature. She was well past her
youth and yet, in spite of her comfortable
plumpness and the few grey hairs among
the black ones, to the persons who loved
her she seemed to grow prettier and
sweeter as she grew older. Certainly her
own family adored her.</p>
<p>But Billy Webster, her son, was a delicate
boy with fair hair and large blue eyes. His
expression was difficult to understand until
one came to know that Billy questioned
everything, but, having decided for himself
acted, whenever it was possible, solely upon
his own judgment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>When Dan Webster started forward to
join his mother and offer his morning greeting,
one felt better satisfied. For, except
that he was big and strong and virile, he
was exactly like her, both in appearance
and apparently in character.</p>
<p>The Sunrise Hill Camp Fire girls were
in the habit of beginning each day with
some little ceremony appropriate to their
outdoor life and the spirit of their Camp
Fire. Each member had her appointed
time, for a morning ceremony. Today
chanced to be Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>When everybody had assembled she
walked toward a clearing and stood with
her face to the east and her back against
a group of pine trees with a growth of
underbrush between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry all of you were not with me
this morning at daylight. To have recited
my verse then would have been more
appropriate,&rdquo; she began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>However, what she recited was not so
important, since always Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s
audiences heard her with thrilling interest.
For one reason, the voice of the great
actress was so beautiful and appealing.
Like the great Sara Bernhardt she would
have been able to stir her hearers both to
laughter and tears by a mere recital of the
alphabet, could she have spoken as Bernhardt
did in a language unfamiliar to her
listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This verse is a part of the Indian New
Fire ceremony and seemed to me appropriate
to our morning camp fire,&rdquo; she
explained.</p>
<p>Some vivid, charming quality appeared
to be born anew in Polly O&rsquo;Neill Burton
each time she faced an audience, no matter
how small and unimportant. This love
of her work was perhaps the surest
expression of her genius.</p>
<p>She now lifted her head, the color coming
swiftly to her face, and pointing to the sun
and then toward their own fire she spoke in
a beautiful resonant voice:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All people awake, open your eyes, arise,</p>
<p class="t0">Become children of light, vigorous, active, sprightly;</p>
<p class="t0">Hasten clouds from the four world quarters,</p>
<p class="t0">Come snow in plenty, that water may abound when summer appears,</p>
<p class="t0">Come ice and cover the fields, that after planting they may yield abundantly,</p>
<p class="t0">Let all hearts be glad.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>The last words sounded like an invocation
to happiness. However, it was Mrs. Burton
who started forward, saying unexpectedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, there is some one watching us. I
was under the impression I was being followed
in my walk this morning. Why, I
cannot understand! Will you find out who
it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, without replying, Dan went quickly
forward into the nearby woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">A New Girl</span></span></h2>
<p>There was an instant of waiting,
then a little cry quickly suppressed.
Soon after Dan could be heard
returning.</p>
<p>But when he appeared he was half leading,
half carrying, a girl of about fifteen or sixteen
who did not look like a formidable intruder.
She was small and her face was pale; at
the moment her lips were pressed tightly
together. Yet, in spite of her effort at self-control,
her eyes were full of tears, either
of anger, embarrassment or pain.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic1">
<img src="images/pic1.jpg" alt="&ldquo;When He Appeared He Was Half Leading, Half Carrying, a Girl Who Did Not Look Like A Formidable Intruder.&ldquo;" width="500" height="864" />
<p class="center"><span class="sc">&ldquo;When He Appeared He Was Half Leading, Half Carrying, a Girl Who Did Not Look Like A Formidable Intruder.&ldquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>Yet, although Dan was resolutely holding
her to the duty of facing the Camp Fire
party, he was perfectly gentle. It would
have been impossible for him to be
otherwise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Immediately Mrs. Burton walked forward.
There was something about the
girl that attracted her. She was not pretty;
her features were too irregular; she had a
long nose a little crooked, a wide mouth,
and her chin was too sharply pointed for the
breadth of her brow. But her eyes were a
fascinating grey-green with extremely dark
brows and lashes, and her hair was reddish
brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; the Camp Fire guardian
began quickly. &ldquo;Dan and I must both
have been mistaken in thinking you the
person we were seeking. But you must
forgive my nephew, the fault was mine. I
was under the impression that some one was
spying upon us, and who, for some absurd
reason, was not willing to be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. &ldquo;You were
not mistaken. I have been watching you&mdash;or
trying to&mdash;since early this morning. And
I hate your having discovered me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke quietly in a soft but at the
same time throaty voice, as if she were a
little hoarse.</p>
<p>Polly Burton was puzzled and yet it was
stupid of her to have been. It was true
that here in the West in the past few months,
living outdoors with her group of Camp Fire
girls, she had honestly forgotten a number
of facts about herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at this instant, murmuring something
or other in apology, Dan Webster moved
a few steps aside.</p>
<p>The girl turned her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let go your hold on me,&rdquo; she
said almost angrily.</p>
<p>Again Dan held out his arm and this
time the girl clutched it.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s face was crimson; he felt the
whole situation to be extraordinarily awkward.
He was not quick either in thought
or action and undoubtedly he was confused
by the words and the behavior of the girl
who had been his prisoner a few moments
before. Now she held on to him as if she
dared not let go. He could feel her hand
trembling on his arm and indeed her whole
body was shaking.</p>
<p>Then Dan gave an inward sigh of relief,
seeing that his mother was approaching
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have hurt yourself, haven&rsquo;t you,
child?&rdquo; she began in a sensible comfortable
fashion. &ldquo;I presume you were merely
curious about my sister and our Camp Fire
proceedings. I know the information has
gone out over the neighborhood that we
wished to be left to ourselves. You understand
my sister has to see so many people
when she is playing that she has let it be
known she wishes to meet nobody here.
If you have been trying to see her without
being observed, she must remember a time,
which does not seem so long ago to me,
when she was only a stage-struck girl herself.
There, take my arm and let Dan help you to
my tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl had looked unhappy at the
beginning of Mrs. Webster&rsquo;s speech, but
before the close she laughed a little
uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid <i>that is</i> true,&rdquo; she returned.
&ldquo;In any case I owe you an apology, Mrs.
Burton.&rdquo; She had dropped the lids over
her eyes to hide her chagrin, but she went
on honestly. &ldquo;I suppose I am a stage-struck
girl, although I do not like hearing
myself called one. But I did come over
here this morning at daylight for a look
at your camp. Of course I never dreamed
of seeing you. But when you started for
your walk I did go along near you, as I did
not suppose you would either see or hear
me. But it was wonderful just to be so
near you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>In the meantime Peggy Webster had
slipped forward and now stood alongside
her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hateful, Tante,&rdquo; she whispered
warningly, knowing from experience that
her aunt&rsquo;s good nature was not always to be
relied upon under trying circumstances.
Moreover she had forgotten, as ninety-nine
people out of a hundred do, when they
arrive at distinction, how she had felt
toward famous persons in her own youth.</p>
<p>But on this occasion Peggy need not have
been uneasy.</p>
<p>The new girl was evidently of gentle
breeding in spite of the shabbiness of her
attire and the fact that she was rather more
plain than good looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, child, it is oftentimes distinctly
disagreeable to be near me, as my
Camp Fire girls may tell you. But come
and have breakfast with us, if you really
have been prowling about since daylight as
I have. I am dreadfully hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>She started away with Peggy, expecting
the others to follow. Either Mrs. Burton
had not heard her sister&rsquo;s speech, or else
believed that her beloved Mollie was only
fussing over the newcomer&rsquo;s health as she
did over everybody&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I would rather not be
troublesome,&rdquo; the new girl answered.</p>
<p>At this she let go Dan&rsquo;s arm and took a
step forward. But the pain of walking
alone was too great for her self-control.</p>
<p>As people always did in disaster she
turned to Mrs. Webster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I have hurt myself and it is so
stupid of me. Really I don&rsquo;t know what
to do. You see I did not want to be discovered
and when I heard some one coming
after me I started to run. I must have
tripped and fallen over a stump in the
underbrush. As soon as I got up I was a
prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>She flashed a peculiar glance at Dan
Webster; but whether she was angry or
amused over his discomfiture it was difficult
to decide. Yet Dan looked wretched
enough to satisfy the most teasing desire
for revenge. He had the sweetest and
most chivalrous temper in the world. No
one ever remembered Dan&rsquo;s deliberately
hurting any one in his life. Now he
undoubtedly felt as if he had caused a
perfectly innocent girl to do herself a
painful injury and had afterwards treated
her with unpardonable rudeness. But it
was not difficult to make Dan Webster
feel himself in the wrong, both his sister
Peggy, and his twin brother, frequently
taking advantage of this trait of his
character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not a prisoner in any sense,&rdquo;
Mrs. Webster replied, speaking more coldly,
and appreciating Dan&rsquo;s embarrassment.
&ldquo;But if you are hurt we shall be glad to do
what we can for you and some one will
drive you back to your home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More humbly the girl then took hold of
Mrs. Webster&rsquo;s proffered arm, and still
holding on to Dan, started toward Mrs.
Webster&rsquo;s tent not many yards away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>In a curious fashion Dan felt that, in
spite of her pretense of anger, the girl by
his side felt a reliance upon him. And for
some reason he could not explain he was
interested in her. She was not half so
pretty as many of the Camp Fire girls&mdash;Sally
Ashton and Gerry Williams for
instance. Yet there was something fascinating
in her grey-green eyes, in her long
nose with that funny twist at the end of it,
and in the uncertainty of her behavior.</p>
<p>Naturally Dan thought it ridiculous of
the strange girl to have been hiding about
in their neighborhood for the very ordinary
pleasure of beholding his famous aunt.</p>
<p>Dan did not take Mrs. Burton or her
fame as an actress seriously. Indeed,
unconsciously he had inherited some of his
father&rsquo;s old prejudice against women in
any kind of public life. He was fond of his
aunt, but not as Peggy was, or even his
brother, Billy. For, although Billy did not
bestow much affection upon any human
being, except his mother and Vera Lageloff,
he admired Mrs. Burton, was proud of her
success, and was really more influenced by
her opinion than any one&rsquo;s else.</p>
<p>The new girl walked with difficulty, but
Dan could not help admiring her pluck.
Ordinarily her skin was sallow but it was
an odd greenish-white at present.</p>
<p>Outside his mother&rsquo;s tent Dan departed
to find Ellen Deal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Since the arrival of the Sunrise Camp Fire
girls in Arizona, Ellen Deal had had but
few opportunities for the display of her
usefulness as a trained nurse. She had
not graduated in nursing, since a breakdown
in health had prevented her from finishing
the last year of training. But she was
older than the other Camp Fire girls and
had come West with them because of Dr.
Sylvia Wharton&rsquo;s request made to her half
sister and always her beloved friend, Polly
O&rsquo;Neill, or Mrs. Richard Burton.</p>
<p>The call to the sick, however, with Ellen
was like the call to arms with a soldier.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, when Dan was
finishing a belated breakfast, Ellen
reappeared and sat down beside him. The
next moment he saw the new girl come out
of his mother&rsquo;s tent with her assistance and
drop down on a cushion outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing serious the matter, as far as I
can tell,&rdquo; Ellen announced in the business-like
manner which seems to be considered
professional. &ldquo;Nevertheless I would like
to have a doctor if one can be found over
at the hotel or anywhere nearby. Our
unexpected visitor has bruised and strained
her knee and it may be worse than I think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dan won&rsquo;t you take your victim, or our
victim, her breakfast,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton suggested,
smiling and yet looking sympathetic.
Having finished her own breakfast she and
Peggy had arranged a breakfast tray for
their uninvited guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit here, Dan,&rdquo; his mother announced
a few moments later on his arrival before
her tent. Then she hurried away to her
own meal.</p>
<p>Dan sat silently watching the new girl.</p>
<p>She was evidently trying to show self-control.
Yet it seemed impossible for her
to choke the breakfast down, in spite of the
fact that Sally had made new corn bread
especially for her. Her lips kept twitching
and finally the tears ran unchecked down
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you are in such pain,&rdquo; Dan
said gently, and there was something very
attractive in his gentleness, combined as it
was with his beauty and strength. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
find a doctor for you in a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his surprise his companion again
turned upon him angrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not crying because I am in pain.
I am not quite so ridiculous.&rdquo; Then her
nose twitched in a funny fashion and she
added with the hoarse note in her voice
which was so unusual, &ldquo;I am crying
because I am such a&mdash;such a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his wish to be sympathetic,
Dan laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is a common enough experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered quietly, &ldquo;there are
a good many foolish people in the world, I
know, but there are degrees. It seems to
me I am the most hopeless kind.&rdquo; She
turned her eyes full upon Dan and curiously
he was reminded of certain pools in his own
New Hampshire woods on a soft grey day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Marta Clark. I meant
to tell you before. My brother and I are
here living in a tent not far away from your
camp&mdash;a few miles I believe. My brother
broke down in health and we had to come
out here because of him. He is still very
ill and I have been taking care of him. If
I can&rsquo;t even hobble about for a few days
I don&rsquo;t know what is to become of us.
Besides he has not the faintest idea where
I am. I realized he would not allow me to
prowl about trying to see Mrs. Burton if he
knew, although he and I had talked of her
being here. We had seen her act once and
adored her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll find some one able to look
after him for a few days well enough,&rdquo; Dan
replied, not viewing the matter as seriously
as his new acquaintance did.</p>
<p>Again the girl flashed what seemed to be
an angry glance toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t enjoy your forcing me to confess
the fact,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but my brother
and I are desperately poor&mdash;far too poor
to hire any one to take care of us, even for a
few days. He was working and taking care
of me, and when his illness came we had
almost nothing. He was only a reporter
on a paper and I was at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Dan firmly, &ldquo;I am
sure we shall manage in some way to have
you cared for until you are all right again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face cleared, and Dan noticed
that she had a rather care-worn look which
her words had just explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should feel it when
we are utter strangers, but you do look as
if you could make things happen the way
they should. I suppose it is because you
are strong and patient. I am neither of
those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they could not go on talking because,
at this moment, the Camp Fire guardian
was coming toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Patient</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;But it is awfully kind of you, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Deal shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I shall
like it. Since I came out West with you
and the Camp Fire girls, Mrs. Burton, I
have been feeling that perhaps I was here
under false pretenses. You see I am older
than the other girls, and came partly because
Dr. Sylvia told me I might be useful to you.
Except for showing you a few first aid
remedies I have not been useful at all. I
don&rsquo;t feel that I am a particularly agreeable
companion, so I add nothing to the pleasure
of the Camp Fire in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; the Camp Fire guardian
responded. Nevertheless a slight pang of
self-reproach assailed her. Had she allowed
Ellen Deal to feel that she was of less interest
to the Camp Fire group than the other
girls? It was true that Ellen was older, that
she was midway between the age of a Camp
Fire girl and a possible guardian. But,
more than this, she seemed to have one of
the hard and matter-of-fact natures it is
always difficult to reach. Romance, the
dreams and desires that are a part of nearly
every life, hardly appeared to touch Ellen;
or if they did at least she gave no sign.
In their months together amid perhaps as
beautiful and extraordinary scenery as
there is anywhere in the world, Ellen had
showed no enthusiasm; in her life with the
Camp Fire girls, no especial affection except,
perhaps, in friendship with Alice Ashton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, she was looking in a great
deal better health,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton reflected,
and the present moment was scarcely the
time for introspection by either of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same it is good of you, Ellen,
besides not another one of us would be equal
to the task. But if it is too much for you,
you must let us know. Peggy is going
with you now and I&rsquo;ll drive over in the
morning to see how you are getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Ellen replied gratefully.
Yet she would like to have said so much
more&mdash;to have told Mrs. Burton how
greatly she appreciated her kindness in
allowing her, an entire stranger, to be one
of her group of Camp Fire girls and also
her guest for the past three months. However,
words never came easily to her, for
she was not one of the fortunate persons
who can make themselves charming by the
simple gift of expression, which may or may
not be sincere.</p>
<p>Then she went away to pack her bag with
a few necessary articles for the work ahead
of her.</p>
<p>It was to Ellen Deal that Dan Webster
had first confided the difficult position of
their unexpected guest. Immediately Ellen
had suggested that she go with the new girl
to her camp and there see what should be
done. Besides the fact of her brother&rsquo;s
illness, the girl herself would require looking
after for a few days, if not for a longer time.</p>
<p>Later Mrs. Webster and Mrs. Burton had
given a more or less enforced consents since,
under the circumstances, there seemed
nothing else to be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen certainly looks competent,&rdquo; Polly
decided at this moment, watching her move
away. Her figure was small and neat, suggesting
a great deal of reserve strength; her
sandy hair had grown a shade brighter in
tone from her months in the sunshine and
her always bright color, brighter. It was a
pity that she appeared so severe and critical.</p>
<p>This, also, was Marta Clark&rsquo;s impression,
riding beside Ellen, Dan and Peggy occupying
the front seat of the wagon which the
Camp Fire party ordinarily used for carrying
provisions.</p>
<p>Naturally Marta felt under deep obligations
to the strange young woman beside
her, yet she would like to have been able
to prepare her for certain revelations ahead.</p>
<p>Ellen looked so scrupulously tidy. Then
Marta knew the Camp Fire ideals and
training which Ellen had added to her
nursing ones. And her own housekeeping
left so much to be desired. In fact Marta
realized that she was careless, and her
brother equally so. How would Miss Deal
survive for even a few days with them, in
spite of her spirit of self-sacrifice? Certainly
Marta hated to accept so great a favor as
the care of herself and her brother must
represent. Yet, she too appreciated the
fact that there seemed nothing else to be
done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The ride did not occupy half an hour,
Marta naturally directing the way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock in
the morning before the little party reached
the new camp.</p>
<p>Two tents were situated in a small clearing
at the foot of a rocky hill. Near them
was the remains of a camp fire and not far
away a litter of old papers and tin cans.
In front of one tent there was an invalid&rsquo;s
chair and also a cot. Yet neither of them
were occupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where Rob can be,&rdquo; Marta
said, trying to conceal her evident nervousness
from the three strangers.</p>
<p>She need scarcely have asked the question.
The moment the wagon stopped, a tall,
abnormally thin young fellow came quickly
toward them, evidently having heard their
approach from some distance off. He was
breathless and the color was burning
crimson on his high cheek bones. He
looked like Marta except that he was
handsomer, for his features were more
regular, although the brother and sister had
nearly the same coloring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>He bowed politely enough to the strangers
in the little party. But afterwards, something,
perhaps his own illness and weakness,
seemed to destroy his self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, Marta? What
has happened? I have been searching for
you ever since six o&rsquo;clock. I wakened to
find you gone, and after waiting an hour for
you to come back I thought, or rather I
could not think, what had become of you.
You are considerate not to have left me a
message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an angry sarcasm in the young
man&rsquo;s voice and manner which was extraordinarily
out of place under the circumstances.
Dan felt so sorry for the girl with
them, that he would like to have settled
with her brother, except for the apparent
fact of his illness. But a high temper was
evidently a family characteristic. Dan
recalled Marta&rsquo;s mentioning that she and
her brother were from Kentucky.</p>
<p>But, even while he was speaking, the
young fellow had to grasp hold of the wagon
for support.</p>
<p>Marta was trying to explain to him, when
Ellen Deal climbed quietly out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are not strong enough to be on your
feet any longer; you must have been
walking about for several hours, when you
know you are not expected to take any
exercise,&rdquo; she said authoritatively. Then,
without the least hesitation or embarrassment,
she took the perfectly strange young
man by the elbow and led him to his
chair. He accompanied her without a
protest.</p>
<p>Afterwards, while Dan and Peggy were
helping Marta to alight from the wagon,
Ellen tried to make him understand what
had occurred.</p>
<p>Secretly Rob Clark was both ashamed
and amused by the situation&mdash;ashamed of
his own exhibition of temper, for he was
good-natured on most occasions. But also
he was amused by the strange young
woman&rsquo;s immediate command of him.
However he really was too weak to protest
and, after discovering his sister&rsquo;s
injury, grateful to the newcomer beyond
his present strength to express.</p>
<p>A short time after Ellen was in complete
command, both of the situation and her
two patients.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Marta was stretched on the cot in front
of the tent and her brother had not been
allowed to move from his chair.</p>
<p>With Peggy&rsquo;s and Dan&rsquo;s aid a fresh fire
had been built and beef tea fed the invalid,
who confessed to having had no breakfast
because of his anxiety. Also the confusion
inside the tent had been a little straightened
out, although Dan and Peggy were obliged
to leave when they might still have been
useful.</p>
<p>However, they, too, were under Ellen&rsquo;s
command. She insisted that they drive
over to the big hotel not far away in order
to secure the advice of a physician. He
was to be asked to come at once.</p>
<p>And seeing them depart, promising to
return next day, Marta was not sure whether
she was sorry or glad of the results of her
own impertinence and the accident due to
it. These months alone with her brother
had been very depressing. They had no
friends in the West and now, perhaps, if she
behaved herself, the Camp Fire girls might
be kind to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">A Wager</span></span></h2>
<p>Peggy Webster was standing
alone, smoothing the shaggy coat
of one of the pair of mules hitched
to their wagon. Her brother had gone into
the hotel nearby to find a physician for
their new acquaintance.</p>
<p>Peggy was not wearing her Camp Fire
dress. She was under the impression that
it made her more conspicuous in coming
to a fashionable hotel, such as this one.
The guests might or might not understand
the reason for her unusual costume.</p>
<p>However, being Peggy, characteristically
her toilet was of the simplest and most
convenient kind. She had on a short, tan-colored
corduroy skirt and jacket, a cream
silk blouse and a corduroy hat. She also
wore riding boots of brown leather, finding
them more convenient than ordinary shoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Yet, in spite of her simplicity, perhaps
because of it, she made a charming figure.
She was of medium height and slender, with
broad shoulders and narrow hips; although
Peggy was sixteen, she still suggested in the
carriage of her head and body the vitality
and grace of a boy rather than a girl. It
was difficult to analyze this quality of the
girl&rsquo;s which, however, people recognized
at once. It may have come from a certain
independence of spirit&mdash;a love of outdoor
things&mdash;a straightforwardness and an avoidance
of the emotions which most girls enjoy.
Yet none of these qualities are essentially
boyish, since ninety-nine boys out of a
hundred may not possess them, but the
description is used for want of a better one.</p>
<p>From the three months of living outdoors
Peggy&rsquo;s olive skin was a deeper tone and her
color more brilliant. In her Camp Fire
costume she sometimes wore her hair loose;
but on occasions like this, it was braided and
fastened close about her small head. In
looking close at Peggy, what one was forced
to admire in her most was the clearness and
beauty of her dark eyes, which stared
straight into yours with a perfect faith that
the ideals of every human being were as
clear and sincere as her own. Another
charm was the unconsciously proud tilt of
her short, straight nose and chin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Glancing up to see if her brother had
finished his errand, Peggy saw an immaculate
figure coming toward her over the
carefully tended grounds of the hotel.</p>
<p>She waved a friendly hand toward him,
the young man returning her greeting more
languidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gotten up regardless, aren&rsquo;t you
Ralph?&rdquo; Peggy remarked good-naturedly,
as Ralph Marshall joined her.</p>
<p>She did not dislike him as Bettina
Graham did; indeed Peggy rarely disliked
any one. And Ralph had been coming to
their place in New Hampshire for a portion
of his holidays for several years. He was
ordinarily sweet-tempered and obliging and
his affectations and lack of interest in
serious matters only amused Peggy, if she
happened to think of them at all, while they
made Bettina angry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am showing the West how the
thing ought to be done,&rdquo; he answered with
equal good temper, surveying himself with
a not unpleasant vanity. For Ralph was
extraordinarily good looking&mdash;rather too
much so to be desirable in a man, according
to some ideas. In spite of the fact that
it was morning, Ralph was wearing a
tennis costume of such amazing perfection
that he suggested a magazine advertisement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would soon get tired of
roughing it on Mr. Gardener&rsquo;s ranch,&rdquo;
Peggy went on. &ldquo;After a while, Ralph,
you will have surveyed all human occupations
and found none of them worth the
effort of pursuing, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph laughed. &ldquo;I say, Peggy, that is
unworthy of you. Such severity should
have come from Bettina Graham. Why
can&rsquo;t you think I left the Gardener ranch
in order to be nearer the Camp Fire girls,
even if you are not enthusiastic over my
society? By the way, Terry Benton and
Howard Brent are here with me for a few
weeks. They both felt a holiday was due
them, and naturally, as I was so near, I
wished to see the Grand Canyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy nodded. &ldquo;I am glad Howard
Brent is with you, I like him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>This also was characteristic of Peggy
Webster. Most girls would not have been
willing to be so straightforward in expressing
an interest. But really it did not occur
to Peggy that she should not state her
liking for Howard Brent as freely as if he
had been a girl; and, of course, there was
no reason why she should not.</p>
<p>However, Ralph felt slightly annoyed.
He was accustomed to being both admired
and flattered by his girl acquaintances.
Even Bettina Graham&rsquo;s dislike of him was
more agreeable than Peggy&rsquo;s good-natured
indifference.</p>
<p>Moreover, Peggy&rsquo;s expression had at this
instant changed, as she went quickly forward
to greet the two young men who were
advancing toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is awfully good luck to have you so
near our camp again; I hope you will both
come over to see us,&rdquo; Ralph heard her say
the moment after she had shaken hands
with the newcomers. She had not suggested
a visit to him.</p>
<p>Howard Brent and Terry Benton in a
lesser degree were types of men whom
Peggy might have been expected to admire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Howard Brent was the son of an Arizona
ranchman and was himself one. He was a
big, strong, fearless fellow of about twenty;
having spent most of his life outdoors, he
was nearly as dark in appearance as Peggy
herself and almost as straightforward.
Terry, of course, was an Irishman and,
although he also lived outdoors, he had
the Irish subtleties and the ability to laugh
at himself, which Peggy could not at this
time of her life understand.</p>
<p>A short time after, while the little group
of four were continuing to talk, Dan
Webster came out from the hotel. Ralph
Marshall introduced him to his two friends
and straightway they fell into a discussion
of future plans.</p>
<p>Dan was younger than the other men and
had never been west before. But he had
spent his life in the New Hampshire woods
and was devoted to outdoor sports. Moreover,
he was tremendously grateful and
enthusiastic over the suggestion of his two
new acquaintances, that he join them in the
hunting and tramping expeditions which
they were then planning.</p>
<p>He knew Ralph Marshall, of course, and
they were friendly enough, but had no particular
liking for each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are not going to join in these
strenuous enterprises, are you, Ralph?&rdquo;
Peggy asked as she and Dan were about to
climb back into their wagon to return to
their own camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Ralph demanded, flushing
a little, not so much from Peggy&rsquo;s tone,
which had been nothing but friendly, but
from the attitude which he suspected in
the other three men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for no reason at all,&rdquo; Peggy returned
quickly, &ldquo;only that I thought you liked
other amusements better. You know I
don&rsquo;t think a great deal of trying to destroy
things, although so long as I like to eat
what Dan kills I suppose I can&rsquo;t criticise his
hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her first speech Peggy had had no idea
of hurting Ralph&rsquo;s feelings, or even his self-esteem,
which is what people are apt to hurt
in us. Therefore, appreciating the fact
that he seemed a little uncomfortable, she
had attempted to change the subject.
Moreover, in saying good-bye she gave her
hand last to Ralph, looking at him with an
appeal for forgiveness for her unconscious
awkwardness. Under the circumstances
she found it impossible to apologise openly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Ralph Marshall had not Peggy&rsquo;s generosity
of nature. He said good-bye with
perfect politeness, but the girl still felt that
he was chagrined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully girl, isn&rsquo;t she? As good a sport
I should think as the best kind of a fellow!&rdquo;
Howard Brent exclaimed after Dan and
Peggy had driven off.</p>
<p>For a moment Terry Benton whistled
softly before replying. Then, being an
Irishman, he was a little enigmatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are made differently, aren&rsquo;t they,
girls? We men may be cut after the same
pattern, but sometimes I believe no two
girls are alike. Personally I like the old-fashioned
types better. Peggy Webster
would be the best kind of a comrade I
expect, but somehow I suppose, being Irish,
I could stand for a little more sentiment
than she possesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In point of fact Terry was then thinking
of Sally Ashton, by whom, since their first
meeting, he had been strongly attracted.
But there was no distinction in this, as
Sally attracted most men. She also made
most of them believe that she was filled with
exquisite, womanly emotions, when, in
reality she had not half the hidden depth of
feeling that Peggy&rsquo;s finer and more sincere
nature concealed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Ralph Marshall had been listening to his
two friends, without entering into the conversation,
but he now shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you and Benton are both wrong,
Brent; girls are all alike. It is only that
they are better actresses than men are and
can appear to be different. I&rsquo;ll bet Peggy
Webster is as sentimental and as vain as
most of them. I&rsquo;ll wager I can prove it to
you. She is an only girl and has lived
surrounded by an adoring family. I don&rsquo;t
suppose she has ever had any man pay her
the least attention. If she had she would be
like all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry Benton laughed. &ldquo;Friend Ralph
is a trifle annoyed, isn&rsquo;t he? Hasn&rsquo;t
Mistress Peggy been sufficiently impressed?
Anyhow, Marshall, you can be pretty sure
she will never change her temperament for
either of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll bet you a
hundred I could make her like me if I tried
hard enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Taken,&rdquo; Terry Benton replied quickly.</p>
<p>Until this moment Howard Brent had
been silent during the conversation which
his own words had innocently provoked.
However, his face had crimsoned and he
was now looking rather angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You men are a couple of&mdash;oh, you know
well enough what I would like to call you
without my saying the word,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;But, in any case, kindly don&rsquo;t consider me
a third in this transaction. It is rather
hard luck to have had to stay and hear this
much of your conversation.&rdquo; He turned
angrily away.</p>
<p>Terry Benton followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t take a joke so seriously,
Howard. Marshall is ridiculous about
himself, although he is a fine enough chap
in some ways. I only took up that proposition
of his because I thought it would be
a good thing for him to lose. He needs
to be taken down by a Peggy or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the two men were walking
away, it was still possible for Ralph Marshall
to overhear what they were saying. He
felt fairly uncomfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>He had spoken at first without any
particular realization of the significance of
his words and without any direct intention
of involving himself in a wager, which
certainly appeared objectionable upon the
face of it. Then, as often happens, the
situation had gotten beyond him.</p>
<p>He wished now that he had never mentioned
Peggy. It was bad form for men
to discuss a girl with other men, and
certainly it was a good deal worse form to
have made so absurd a bet concerning one.
It was Benton&rsquo;s own fault. He should not
have taken him up so quickly; he should
have understood that he had spoken without
thinking.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Ralph was not sure that he
would not still like to prove to Terry that
he could make good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">A Study in Temperaments</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;But, Vera, you must not continue
waiting on Billy in this fashion;
he is ever so much better and
perfectly able to look after himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Webster had just walked across from
where she had been sitting with her sister
sewing, to a particularly beautiful spot
where Vera Lageloff and Billy Webster had
been spending the afternoon together. It
had been cool during the morning but, with
the coming of the afternoon, the sun had
shone clearly and warmly.</p>
<p>Vera and Billy had chosen a place near
the foot of the hill, down which ran the
stream of water that supplied the camp,
and near the tiny lake which the Camp Fire
girls had conventionally named their wishing
well.</p>
<p>Here, in spite of the warm weather, they
had built a small camp fire, for there was
a quantity of wood from the pine trees
nearby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>They had been together for an hour or so,
and Mrs. Webster had just observed Vera
make the third trip to their group of tents
and then return to Billy.</p>
<p>She was standing now with her arms
filled with papers and magazines, which
she had just secured.</p>
<p>Vera laughed. &ldquo;Oh, Billy hates to
move, and I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied a little
apologetically.</p>
<p>But Billy, who should have been the
apologetic one, did not appear so in the
least.</p>
<p>He was sitting on an Indian blanket
which had been spread by Vera before their
small fire, smiling placidly at his mother
and friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think people ought to be
allowed to do what they like, Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy did not ask this question in a
humorous fashion, as one might suppose
under the circumstances, but quite seriously.
However, Billy nearly always appeared
serious, and yet one never could be sure
what spirit hid itself behind his large,
abstracted blue eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Mrs. Webster sighed as she sat down
beside him. Billy was the least satisfying
of her three children and she made no pretense
of understanding him. Yet his illness
and his physical need of her brought him
nearer to her than any one in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think people ought to do what they
like only when they can be perfectly fair
to others at the same time,&rdquo; she answered
gently.</p>
<p>This time Billy smiled. &ldquo;If one is wanting
a thing very hard for oneself, it is not
always easy to remember other people;
although, of course, it is right,&rdquo; he agreed
unexpectedly. &ldquo;Still I don&rsquo;t believe I am
doing Vera any serious injustice. She
does a great deal more of the Camp Fire
work than any of the other girls, and yet
none of you realize it. The difference
between us is that I do realize what she
does for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vera had also taken a place on the ground
with her two companions and Billy now
reached over and took hold of her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>There was nothing sentimental or emotional
in the unusual friendship between
the boy and girl, although their devotion
to each other was so apparent, and neither
ever made the least effort at concealing it.
But it was the kind of affection that sometimes
exists, even if but rarely, between a
brother and sister, and only when the
sister is older and the brother unusual.</p>
<p>Vera&rsquo;s hand was the larger of the two,
or at least it appeared so, because the palm
was broad and the fingers long and capable.
It was the hand of a person whose ancestors
had worked with their hands, while Billy&rsquo;s
hand was extraordinarily thin and delicate,
with blue veins and long tapering fingers.
Vera continued to hold it in hers as unconsciously
as a mother might have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about me, please, Mrs.
Webster?&rdquo; she protested smiling. &ldquo;What
I most want is some day to be able to do
some kind of work that is worth while.
Billy is quite right; I do like work, although
I don&rsquo;t call the little things I do for him by
any such name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mollie Webster studied the two friends
more closely than they appreciated.
Although fond of Vera she could not help,
motherlike, being slightly jealous of the
friendship between Vera and her son. She
accepted the fact of Vera&rsquo;s better understanding
of him; or if not understanding, at
least her complete sympathy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I was worrying about
you, Vera; I must be truthful,&rdquo; Mrs.
Webster continued. &ldquo;You see, mothers
are pretty selfish, so it was Billy I was
actually thinking of. I don&rsquo;t feel worried
over your future; you&rsquo;ll be sure to turn
out all right, if you have the proper opportunities.
But I don&rsquo;t know what will
become of Billy. You see, dear you are so&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lazy,&rdquo; Billy drawled, good humoredly,
finishing his mother&rsquo;s sentence. &ldquo;Say the
dreadful word; I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Webster shook her head. &ldquo;I know
you don&rsquo;t worry over your future, and that
is the worst of it. You don&rsquo;t ever try to
think of what you wish to do. Dan has
already decided to be a scientific farmer, as
his father is, and will study agriculture at
college. But you, you won&rsquo;t ever talk of
what you would like to do. You know
you won&rsquo;t even exert yourself enough at
the present time to get as strong as you
should. If you would only walk about
more. You might have ridden this afternoon
with the others. Dan and Sally both
said they would come back with you as
soon as you wished, or if Vera had gone
with you, she would have seen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Mrs. Mollie Webster&rsquo;s tone was plaintive.
She was apt to be plaintive in talking to
Billy; it was so difficult to make him do
what she wished. It was not that he
opposed her, only that he did not seem to
be convinced, or even aroused, by other
people&rsquo;s opinions of him.</p>
<p>He now remained placidly staring up at
the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it foolish to worry over
the future when one may not have any
future?&rdquo; He asked this question in his
usual impersonal way, and then added, as
if he were surprised at his own sudden
conviction, &ldquo;Do you know I believe I
might have a good deal of energy if anything
ever strikes me as important enough to
make me exert myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vera laughed. &ldquo;I wonder what that will
ever be? But I wouldn&rsquo;t worry, if I were
you, Mrs. Webster. Billy will be a great
writer, some day. He has such queer ideas
and is so original.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Billy drew away his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be tiresome and conventional,
Vera, like everybody else,&rdquo; he remarked
pettishly, like the spoiled boy he was.
&ldquo;I have told you a dozen times, whenever
you mention that idea of yours to me, that
I don&rsquo;t want to write. It must require a
dreadful lot of work. Predict that future
for Bettina Graham; she yearns after
authorship. I would rather talk than
write any day; it is so much easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Webster flushed and looked
annoyed, but Vera paid no attention to
Billy&rsquo;s protests. She seldom did.</p>
<p>However, their conversation was interrupted
by several Camp Fire members who
rode up and dismounted by the side of Mrs.
Burton who had stopped her reading and
gotten up to greet them.</p>
<p>The girls had been away for the past
two hours, leaving no one in camp save the
group of four and Marie, who was busy in
one of the tents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Mr. Simpson had gone with them more
as chaperon than guide. He rode in first,
attired in his rusty outfit, and looking much
more himself than on his first and last
essay into the realms of fashion. Not once
since the evening of Marie&rsquo;s refusal of him
had he been seen in his &ldquo;store clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was followed by Bettina Graham
and Howard Brent, and behind them came
Sally Ashton and Terry Benton. Later, Alice
and Gerry returned leading their burros
and talking to the two young men beside
them, who had come over with the others
from the hotel for the ride. They were
both acquaintances of Howard Brent&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are Peggy and Ralph Marshall?&rdquo;
Mrs. Burton inquired of Bettina five
minutes later, seeing that they were the
only two members of the riding party who
had so far failed to appear. The young
men were to stay for supper and the girls
had returned early in order to make the
necessary preparations for them. They
had been promised a particularly superior
feast as an evidence of the Camp Fire
prowess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Bettina frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why
Ralph and Peggy did not keep up with the
rest of us. Mr. Simpson insisted that we
should all ride as close together as we conveniently
could. But they kept dropping
behind and getting off their ponies to look
at views. I don&rsquo;t understand Peggy&rsquo;s
intimacy with Ralph Marshall for the past
few days. I did not think she liked him
much better than I did until just lately.
Howard Brent is ten times nicer and likes
her ever so much, but she will have nothing
to do with him. He has to accept my poor
society as a substitute and he gets dreadfully
bored with me. I know so little about
outdoor things compared to Peggy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina&rsquo;s tones were distinctly aggrieved.
She and Peggy were such devoted friends
that she was annoyed at Peggy&rsquo;s sudden
friendship with a person whom she thought
so ordinary and uninteresting, as she considered
Ralph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and Peggy are about as unlike as
two people ever were in this world,&rdquo; she
added crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ralph is nice enough, &lsquo;Tall Princess;&rsquo;
you never were altogether fair in
your estimate of him. Some people in this
world must be frivolous, and Ralph has
never been up against a difficulty, or in fact
against anything that might develop his
character,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Polly Burton put her arm across Bettina&rsquo;s
slender shoulders, giving her a slight
squeeze. She was recalling how she used
to feel as a girl when Bettina&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s&mdash;then
Betty Ashton&mdash;developed an interest
in people, whom she&mdash;then Polly O&rsquo;Neill&mdash;never
felt worthy of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides Peggy may do Ralph good,&rdquo;
she continued. &ldquo;Peggy is fine, and Ralph&mdash;well,
Ralph is not fine, Bettina, although I
do not dislike him as you do. I suppose
they will be along in a few minutes. Peggy
would not like to shirk her share of the
work tonight. If anything has happened,
however, I think it may be Peggy who will
have to look after Ralph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina then went away to take off her
riding clothes and get into her ceremonial
Camp Fire dress. Mrs. Burton continued
watching for Peggy&rsquo;s return. She carefully
avoided coming in contact with her
sister, hoping that Mrs. Webster would
not observe Peggy&rsquo;s absence, as the camp
was now more or less in an uproar with
the girls&rsquo; effort to get dinner and their
guests to render assistance, which usually
consisted in getting in the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Polly tried not to be uneasy, as she
thoroughly believed in Peggy&rsquo;s ability to
take care of herself and other people as
well. However, when nearly an hour
passed and she and Ralph had not appeared,
she began to grow uncomfortable.</p>
<p>About an eighth of a mile away there
was a shelter among the trees where Mr.
Simpson looked after the camp burros
and provisions.</p>
<p>Thinking to ask him what should be done
in order to find the wayfarers, Mrs. Burton
slipped apart from the others and started
along a narrow path through the woods.</p>
<p>But a few yards along the way she heard
Peggy&rsquo;s and Ralph&rsquo;s voices and waited for
them to come up to her.</p>
<p>They were walking in single file and also
leading their burros.</p>
<p>Peggy was in front. When Mrs. Burton
caught sight of her, Peggy&rsquo;s eyes were
shining and her cheeks glowing with color
after a fashion they had when she was
especially happy or excited.</p>
<p>She passed the bridle of her burro to
Ralph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take him to Mr. Simpson along with
your&rsquo;s, won&rsquo;t you, Ralph, please, and
then come on to camp?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Then she slid her arm into her aunt&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, Tante; you look dreadfully
severe,&rdquo; she murmured, rubbing her
cheek against Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s shoulder in a
funny, boyish way she had had ever since
she was a tiny girl. &ldquo;I know we are late,
but Ralph and I have had an adventure
since the others left. We did not intend to
be so long in returning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">Possibilities</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It really was exciting for a few
moments, Billy. I do wish you had
been with us; you would have
known better what to do and say to the men!&rdquo;
Peggy Webster exclaimed.</p>
<p>Sitting bolt upright, Billy Webster was
actually looking animated&mdash;his eyes and
color bright with a peculiar transparency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be exciting for them before the
matter is settled,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Funny
for you and Marshall to have run into a
place of that character, when I thought we
were living out in the wilderness. Please
tell me exactly what happened, Peg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy chanced to be sitting alone beside
her brother about five minutes after her
return to camp, Ralph Marshall not yet
having come back from his errand. Mrs.
Webster and Vera had both departed to
help with dinner, suggesting that Peggy
remain and rest after her long ride, as they
would attend to her share of the work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Peggy sat with her shoulders hunched up
and, leaning forward, talked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd, wasn&rsquo;t it? Ralph and I had
dropped behind the others and were talking.
We had ridden away from the neighborhood
of the canyons through the pine woods.
Then, quite suddenly, we came upon a
group of tents. You see we had gotten off
the road and in some places had gone
single file in between the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder they were surprised at
your turning up,&rdquo; Billy commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprised!&rdquo; Peggy&rsquo;s tone was reflective.
&ldquo;I think that is putting the case pretty
mildly, Billy. The men were extremely
angry at our riding calmly into what they
doubtless believed their secret hiding place.
Their tents were in a little hollow, with
hills and trees around them. The men
were sitting before the fire smoking, when
I came upon them. As I chanced to be
in front, one of them jumped up, said
something ugly, and then grabbed my
bridle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy Webster frowned. &ldquo;Were you
frightened, Peggy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>The girl had dropped back on the ground
and was now lying with her hands clasped
under her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so; I was too amazed.
Besides, Ralph Marshall rode up almost at
once and explained that we had lost our
way. The trouble now is, I am so curious.
The men were very rough and were undoubtedly
in hiding or they would never have
behaved so strangely. Yet surely we are
past the days in the West when stage
coaches and trains used to be held up,
aren&rsquo;t we? Besides, these men had women
and children with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some one was at this instant coming
toward them and Billy glanced around. It
was odd how much animation, even determination,
had lately come into his ordinarily
listless face and manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ride over tomorrow and find out
who the men are and why they are hiding
so near here,&rdquo; he announced as calmly as
if such an action had been a daily proceeding
on his part. &ldquo;Marshall, you&rsquo;ll tell me how
to get there?&rdquo; he added, for Ralph, during
the moment, had joined them.</p>
<p>He now gazed down with unconscious
condescension at the younger boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think this group of fellows
exactly in your line of business, Billy. If
I had not said I would not, I should like to
report their hiding place to the nearest
sheriff. But, as long as your sister was
with me, we simply had to slide out of an
uncomfortable situation as easily as we
could. I must say she did not mind so
much as I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph now looked upon Peggy with an
expression no girl or woman could fail to
enjoy. It was veiled, of course, and only
revealed a reasonable degree of admiration,
yet there was nothing excessive and
certainly nothing sentimental in it. For
Ralph had the wisdom which belongs to the
people who know how to make themselves
agreeable. He understood something of
the temperament of the person he was
trying to win. From the first he had known
that he must appear to be simple and genuine
with Peggy Webster in order to cultivate
her intimate friendship and affection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>However, Ralph was sincere. He had
admired the calm manner in which Peggy
had accepted a disagreeable situation. The
type of girl, with whom he usually preferred
spending his time, would probably
have been both frightened and cross, and
would doubtless have blamed him for
getting her into an awkward position.</p>
<p>But Peggy had been perfectly reasonable.
Indeed, it never seemed to have occurred
to her to pretend that she was not equally
responsible for their straying off from the
others, because she had wished it as much as
he had. But, then, Peggy Webster apparently
never pretended anything! She was
too straightforward to be considered attractive
by the men who wish for greater subtleties
in their girl friends, as Ralph believed he did.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was agreeable to ride
quietly back to camp, discussing their
recent experience as one would have discussed
it with another fellow, simply from
the standpoint of curiosity.</p>
<p>The men they had come upon so unexpectedly
had looked like an ugly group.
However, they had realized that their
encounter with them had been an accident,
and they had not been particularly rude
to Peggy. It would be difficult for any
one to be, Ralph decided, as he sat down
beside her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Peggy had gotten halfway up and her
dark hair was tumbled about her flushed
face. She had not thought to go away
and dress as the other girls had, although
her costume was dusty from her ride. She
had not even a proper share of vanity and
self-consciousness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Peggy was genuinely
pleased at Ralph&rsquo;s coming directly to her
and Billy and taking his place beside them
without stopping to talk with any one
else.</p>
<p>In the last few days she had found herself
liking Ralph very much. In a way this
was odd, for she had known him for some
time without caring much about him in
one way or the other. However, then
Ralph had never paid her any particular
attention; only recently had he seemed
to like being with her more than with any
of the other girls. Peggy honestly thought
the other Camp Fire girls far more attractive
than she could ever be.</p>
<p>Then Ralph did not seem to her nothing
but a society fellow, although this was
what Bettina Graham insisted. At least
he played a good game of tennis, for Peggy
had been over to his hotel on two mornings
to play with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we dance this evening, won&rsquo;t you save
most of your dances for me?&rdquo; Ralph
leaned over to murmur in a low voice, so
that their other companion could not hear.</p>
<p>And Billy did not overhear, although he
arose at this moment and stood staring
with a queer, understanding look in his
blue eyes at his sister and her friend. &ldquo;I
suppose it won&rsquo;t hurt Peg a great deal to
wake up,&rdquo; he whispered to himself. &ldquo;Anyhow,
it would do no good for me to
interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ralph this time had made a mistake,
for Peggy&rsquo;s dark eyes were gazing at him
humorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Ralph,&rdquo; she returned
as good-naturedly and in as matter-of-fact
a tone as if she had been talking to one
of her brothers. &ldquo;You know perfectly that
I don&rsquo;t dance very well; certainly not half
so well as Bettina, and as you never ask me
to dance with you more than once on most
evenings, I don&rsquo;t understand your sudden
change of heart. Really you don&rsquo;t have
to be good to me on account of our
adventure, because I enjoyed it. Suppose
you get Sally or Gerry to amuse you now.
I must help a little with dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Then Peggy and Billy walked off together
leaving Ralph to pull himself up and, feeling
a little aggrieved, to follow Peggy&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>The Camp Fire table was made of long
pine planks set on four logs sawed smooth
and to a proper height.</p>
<p>The somewhat informal table was covered
with a beautiful damask cloth which the
Camp Fire guardian had brought West with
her for just such festival occasions. In the
center and filled with wild flowers was the
great bowl of Indian pottery which she
had purchased from old Nampu in her hut
near the Painted Desert.</p>
<p>Although it was not yet dark a big camp
fire was burning, made bright with pine
cones and branches of pine. In the sombre
old trees surrounding the open space were a
dozen or more golden lanterns. Before
dinner could be finished the early darkness
would have descended, so the lanterns
were merely a preparation for this event.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>The girls kept rushing from the kitchen
tent and the camp fire with great platters
of corn and of freshly baked corn bread and
roasted potatoes. At one end of the table
was a baked ham and at the other a big
dish of broiled chicken. The ham had
been secured from the hotel, but if Marie
Pepin had not yet learned to enjoy a camping
existence, she was true to her French
blood and was a wonderful outdoor cook.
Marie alone could broil chicken in a perfect
fashion above an open camp fire.</p>
<p>Everybody was by this time more than
ready for dinner yet they were kept waiting
for Dan Webster&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>Shortly after his return from the ride
Dan had disappeared, saying that he would
be back in a short time. At least he had
made this statement to Mrs. Burton, for no
one else had discussed his intentions with
him. And she it was who kept urging that
they wait dinner a moment or so longer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>This was most unlike the ordinarily
impatient Mrs. Burton; moreover it was a
Sunrise Camp Fire rule that meals should
wait on no one. However, this rule was
not intended as a disagreeable one to
punish the offender, but only to protect
the guiltless. For, if one were unavoidably
late, it was a simple enough matter to find
oneself something to eat, and far more
comfortable than the sensation of having
kept everyone else waiting.</p>
<p>However, just as dinner was served without
him Dan Webster drove into camp and
the mystery was explained. Seated beside
him was the girl who had been an unexpected
visitor a few mornings before.</p>
<p>She was using a crutch and Dan had to
help her across to a seat beside Mrs. Burton
and then took his place on her other side.</p>
<p>Marta Clark was wearing a little grey-green
dress, evidently her best, although
it was both shabby and old-fashioned. In
it she looked tiny and pale; nevertheless,
both Mrs. Burton and Dan felt the girl&rsquo;s
charm.</p>
<p>Her eyes seemed to have lights behind
them as they shone so oddly, and her lips
were a deep red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is awfully good of you to have me
here,&rdquo; she whispered quietly to Mrs.
Burton. &ldquo;You see, I have been living in
a tent with my brother for a whole year
and this is the first time I have had a meal
with any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>She slipped one hand over and touched
Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I know you think it stupid
and absurd of me, but you can&rsquo;t guess what
it means to me to be sitting so close beside
you. I feel as if I must be dreaming. I
have so wanted to know a great actress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly Burton gave the girl&rsquo;s hand a little
friendly pressure in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must wake up,&rdquo; she said
firmly. &ldquo;You see the girls in my Camp
Fire group don&rsquo;t think of me as an actress,
but only as a more or less successful Camp
Fire guardian. I don&rsquo;t like stage-struck
girls, even if I was one myself once upon a
time, as my sister reminded me. Besides,
why should you care, child, anything about
me or my work. I really don&rsquo;t see why
it should matter to you whether I am an
actress or a&mdash;well let us say a sewing
woman. I should probably have been as
unsuccessful at that as any one could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton laughed and Marta made
no reply. Instead she was wise enough to
change the subject immediately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In any case you have been wonderfully
kind. I am sure I don&rsquo;t know why, but
sometimes it seems as if the wrong things
in this life are rewarded, such as my coming
here uninvited to see you. I wonder if it
was selfish tonight to leave Miss Deal to
look after my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As some one had at that moment distracted
Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s attention by speaking
to her from the other end of the table,
Marta turned to Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been kindest of all,&rdquo; she
remarked with the sudden gentleness she
used as unexpectedly as her sudden flares
of temper.</p>
<p>Both amused Dan. He had seen the new
girl more frequently than any of the other
members of their Camp Fire as, for the past
few days he had driven one or two of them
over each day to call upon Marta and her
brother, or more especially upon Ellen Deal.
The visits were naturally not always to the
two comparative strangers, but to find out
if Ellen were happy and comfortable in her
self-appointed task of caring for two
invalids unknown to her until a short time
before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>After dinner, feeling responsible for their
guest, Dan sat beside her while the others
danced. But, by and by, Sally Ashton,
who did not enjoy having Dan completely
absorbed by any one else, came and asked
him to dance with her. And Marta
insisted that he should.</p>
<p>She was not alone, however, for in a
short time Peggy joined her. For some
reason Peggy had decided not to dance a
single time during the evening. She was
not sure of her own reasons, but gave the
excuse that she was tired.</p>
<p>She was glad now to have the opportunity
of remaining with their guest. For, several
times during the evening, Howard Brent
had seated himself beside her as if he had
something of importance on his mind which
he wished to confide. And then he had
gotten up and gone away without saying it.
Peggy did not wish him to make the attempt
again. She was not in a mood for confidences
and really rejoiced when, at ten
o&rsquo;clock, all of their guests started for home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">An Adventure</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Vera, if you won&rsquo;t go
with me, I will go alone,&rdquo; Billy
Webster announced. &ldquo;It is not
too far for you to go back by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them were riding slowly away
from the Sunrise camp on the following
day.</p>
<p>Vera looked distressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair of you, Billy, to put me in
this position. You know someone ought
to be with you. Won&rsquo;t you let me at least
return and tell your mother what we
intend doing,&rdquo; Vera argued. But she
continued riding even as she protested.
She was just a little behind Billy and he
now turned to look at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on then, dear. You are not
responsible, and whatever happens the
blame is mine. But nothing is going to
happen or I would not have you with me.
So what is the use of worrying mother?
What Peggy told me yesterday interests
me and I mean to find out more about what
those men are planning to do. No one
thinks it extraordinary or tries to prevent
Dan from going out to hunt any kind of
wild beasts he is lucky enough to discover.
But, because I happen to be interested in
hunting out human beings, my family is
always interfering. I haven&rsquo;t the least
intention of hunting them with a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy smiled half seriously and half
humorously and then turned his face away.</p>
<p>But Vera Lageloff and the other people
who knew him intimately always understood
what this expression meant. Billy
had made up his mind; and nothing short
of physical force would compel him to stop
doing what he had determined upon.</p>
<p>Moreover, Vera rarely opposed him.
However unformed his purposes and ideals,
however he might appear to other people
only as an obstinate and ill-balanced boy,
he was Vera&rsquo;s knight. She, at least,
believed in him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>She knew that all his thoughts and all
his ideals for the future were bound up
in his desire to make life easier for the
people whom he did not believe were
having a fair deal. Of course, Billy was
a youthful and rather ignorant socialist,
but for those reasons he was perhaps the
more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Certainly his own family did not understand
him and knew but little of what was
going on inside his mind; but this was not
their fault so much as Billy&rsquo;s. He was
sensitive to ridicule, like many dreamers,
and, moreover, he never felt that he had the
strength for argument. It was easier for
him to do the thing he wished and take
the consequences, rather than argue and
explain. It was enough if Vera and a few
other friends realized that his laziness was
in part physical delicacy, and that he only
acted when he thought the result worth
while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>In a way it was odd that Mr. and Mrs.
Webster should have had so queer a son
and not strange that they should not understand
him. Billy was one of the persons
whom no one ever fully understands and
who never fully understands himself,
because he was intended to travel by a
different route than the most of us. There
was a streak of genius in the O&rsquo;Neill family.
Polly O&rsquo;Neill, now Mrs. Burton, was never
like other people, besides possessing a great
gift as an actress. Perhaps Billy was only
odd without her genius, but the future
alone could answer this question.</p>
<p>To Vera he now appeared a young Sir
Galahad riding in front of her. The boy&rsquo;s
hat was off, his fair hair curling over his
white forehead, he was pale and thin from
his recent illness. But it was a fact that
Billy usually had strength for the things
he wished to do.</p>
<p>Naturally, Billy Webster had not developed
his socialistic ideas alone. Unknown
to his parents there had been a laborer on
his father&rsquo;s place, who had once been a
school teacher in Russia and because of his
views had been compelled to leave. He
had been accustomed to come often to
Vera&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s house, and when Billy was
present to talk for hours on his revolutionary
propaganda. Moreover, Billy also had a
teacher at the High School who, although
saner than the Russian, also wished to make
the world over according to his own plan.
Besides, as Billy was not strong enough to
be outdoors so much as the rest of his family,
he had spent many quiet hours in reading
books on social questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you expect to find your way
to the place, Billy?&rdquo; Vera asked, after five
or ten minutes&rsquo; more of riding in silence.</p>
<p>Again the boy turned his head, laughing
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I don&rsquo;t know, but I pumped
Peggy as much as I could this morning
without actually having my plan found
out. Besides, I am trusting somewhat to
luck. I meant to get some information out
of Marshall when he reached camp this
morning, but he and Peg went off somewhere
to talk. Queer, their being intimate
friends all of a sudden, Vera, don&rsquo;t you
think? I agree with Bettina Graham, I
never knew two people so unlike. And I
don&rsquo;t know whether I admire Marshall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vera frowned. She cared for Peggy
more perhaps than for any of the other
Camp Fire girls and she also had been a
little surprised at her recent behavior. Yet
she answered sensibly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t important, you know, Billy,
whether you like Ralph Marshall or not, so
long as Peggy does. You know you have
said a hundred times you did not think
outsiders had a right to interfere with
friendships. And Peggy&rsquo;s pretty clever!
If she likes Ralph there must be more to
him than the rest of us can see. She don&rsquo;t
like many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy nodded. &ldquo;Yes, that is why I am
puzzled. One does not expect nonsense
from Peg. And Ralph is rather inclined
toward it with most girls. Still you are
right, Vera, and I feel a little snubbed&mdash;like
the fellow always does who is told to
practice what he preaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy laughed back. &ldquo;No, you never do
and you never are. But, come, let&rsquo;s cross
the road here. We must manage to get
lost in the right place&mdash;just as Ralph and
Peggy did. But do you know, Vera,
something already tells me that I am not
going to be happy this afternoon? Fact is,
I am abominably hungry and we can&rsquo;t have
been riding an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop, then, and rest for a little
while,&rdquo; the girl suggested. She had been
afraid that her companion might grow
overtired, as he had taken no long ride
before. &ldquo;You see, I had an idea that we
might both develop an appetite, as lunch
is so early, so I brought along lots of sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy uttered a boyish whoop of delight
which had nothing visionary or unselfish
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trump!&rdquo; he declared getting off his
pony almost at once and then turning to
help Vera.</p>
<p>They were in the pine woods, so it was
easy enough to find an agreeable resting
place under the trees.</p>
<p>In the most natural fashion, after Vera
sat down, Billy stretched himself out resting
his head in her lap. It was the same as if
she had been Peggy, except that he honestly
believed she cared for him more than his
sister did.</p>
<p>Then he deliberately stuffed himself with
sandwiches and talked, as Billy adored
doing when he could find a sympathetic
audience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just want to find out what those
fellows are in hiding for, Vera&mdash;not for any
special reason,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;You see, it
gets a little dull, just lying around all day
in the sun. I like scenery, but I like it as a
background. I am afraid I want a little&mdash;a
little more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excitement,&rdquo; Vera finished the
sentence.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of an hour later Billy
Webster had discovered the secret camp.</p>
<p>He and Vera were riding quietly when
they came to the circle of hills which Peggy
had described. Stopping their ponies they
heard the sound of low voices before seeing
any one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="&ldquo;They Heard the Sound of Low Voices Before Seeing Any One.&rdquo;" width="400" height="707" />
<p class="center"><span class="sc">&ldquo;They Heard the Sound of Low Voices Before Seeing Any One.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>Dismounting, Billy asked Vera to wait
until his return.</p>
<p>It seemed best that she should allow
him to go on his adventure alone, and yet
she watched his slender, boyish figure
disappear, feeling wretchedly uneasy.</p>
<p>What absurd reason had Billy for wishing
to take part in some trouble which assuredly
was no affair of his? If anything happened
to him, Vera knew that she would always
blame herself.</p>
<p>But Billy was entirely unalarmed and,
although he was supposed to be timid,
he was not even nervous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>He walked straight ahead with his hands
in his pockets and a friendly, curious
expression in his big, clear eyes.</p>
<p>Billy could not fully explain the reasons
for his interest. The excuses he had made of
being bored, of wishing to help if the men
were in trouble, or if possible to prevent
trouble if it were brewing, these were
merely somewhat impudent inventions of his.
For, after all, what could he do in any case?</p>
<p>The fact of the matter was that Billy
simply had been seized by an overwhelming
desire to find out what was taking place,
and was more inclined than he should have
been to yield to his own wishes.</p>
<p>Just as they had been doing the afternoon
before, the men were again sitting about a
smouldering camp fire, smoking and talking.</p>
<p>Without being observed Billy walked
quietly up to them.</p>
<p>The next instant one of the men swung
round and cursed him.</p>
<p>Without the least show of fear or anger
the boy waited until the fellow had tired
himself out. Then, instead of running away,
as they plainly wished him to do, he walked
a few steps nearer the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired; would you mind my sitting
here with you a while?&rdquo; he asked in a
matter-of-fact voice. He seemed so friendly
and so totally unafraid that the men must
have been favorably impressed. In any
case, as no one answered at once, he dropped
to the ground between two of the roughest
of the group.</p>
<p>Billy had already observed that the men
were not of the character Peggy and Ralph
suspected them of being.</p>
<p>One of the men now laughed and, leaning
over, thrust his evil smelling pipe at the
delicate boy. And Billy, who had never
smoked a single whiff of anything in his life,
took the pipe gravely, put it to his lips
drawing in the smoke with several hard
puffs. It made him feel slightly ill, yet he
never flinched. When he gave it back the
man appeared more friendly.</p>
<p>A little later Billy asked two or three
simple questions and some one answered
him, afterwards they went on talking as if
he were not there.</p>
<p>Certainly the boy had some quality
which made certain types of people trust
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Fifteen minutes passed. Resting in a
hiding place they had chosen, Vera grew
more and more uneasy. If nothing had
happened to prevent, why had Billy not
returned? If he were all right certainly it
was selfish of him not to care for her
anxiety and dullness.</p>
<p>But, then, Billy was selfish about little
things and Vera recognized the fact. One
had to accept this fault in him, feeling there
were other characteristics which made one
willing to endure it. In big matters the
girl believed he had wonderful stores of
unselfishness.</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards Billy came
strolling toward her as nonchalantly as he
had gone away. Only his eyes were brighter
and his expression less boyish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hurry to get back to camp
before dark,&rdquo; he said, without apologizing
for the delay. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I found
out while we are riding home; but, of course,
I understand I have your promise, Vera,
never to repeat anything I tell you&mdash;no
matter what takes place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Vera nodded silently. She was accustomed
to Billy&rsquo;s confidences and did not
take them all seriously, and this one did
not appear as especially important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men have been working on the railroad
out here and have gone on a strike.
The railroad has refused to come to terms,
but they don&rsquo;t seem to be planning to go
away. They are not exactly in hiding,
only they want to be left alone until they
decide what they are going to do next.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">A Good Samaritan</span></span></h2>
<p>Ellen Deal came out into the
September sunshine with a breakfast
tray in her hand. The tray chanced
to be a flat pine board, but it was covered
with a neat little paper napkin. And,
although the china on it was rough and
failed to match, the aroma of the coffee,
the fragrance of the freshly broiled bacon,
made one indifferent to details.</p>
<p>The tall young man, who had been lying
back in a steamer chair mournfully reading
a torn newspaper several days old, suddenly
straightened up and smiled.</p>
<p>The instant after he had taken the tray
from Ellen&rsquo;s hands his face clouded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your breakfast all right?&rdquo; she
asked, a little furrow appearing in her forehead.
Ellen&rsquo;s expression was nearly always
serious, but it was even more so now.
Although it was so early in the morning and
she had been cooking, she looked exquisitely
neat in a fresh white blouse, a dark
khaki skirt and one of her big hospital
aprons. Her sandy-colored hair, a little
redder from the past week&rsquo;s outdoors, was
drawn English fashion into a kind of bun
at the back of her head. But, although
Ellen tried to be prim, and although she
could control her face, she had rebellious
hair. One knows the kind&mdash;it would break
out into little ripples on her forehead and at
the back of her neck. And her skin, where
it was not exposed, had the peculiar whiteness
and beauty that belongs to her type of
coloring.</p>
<p>The young man in the chair laughed at
her question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My breakfast is perhaps the most perfect
thing that ever happened, or at least that
has happened to me in many a day,&rdquo; he
answered. &ldquo;You see I have been living
under my Sister Marta&rsquo;s ministrations for
a year, and Marta thinks herself above
cooking. She prefers to follow the fine
arts. Truth of the matter is the child has
never been taught anything and has never
had the right kind of feminine influence.
You see, my mother and father died when
Marta was a little girl and she and I have
spent our lives in boarding houses. I don&rsquo;t
mean to criticise her; the child has made a
terrible struggle to take care of me, and it
has been awfully hard on her, staying out
here in the wilds with a hopeless stick of a
brother. You can&rsquo;t imagine what it means&mdash;her
discovery of the Camp Fire girls and
your kindness. As for you, Miss Deal;
well, I haven&rsquo;t words to express my gratitude.
It positively takes away my appetite
for breakfast because I feel under such
obligation to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen flushed uncomfortably. Her companion
was a Southerner and talked easily and
charmingly. He might say he did not know
how to express his gratitude, but this was
not true, for few hours passed in the day
without his showing it in one way or another.</p>
<p>However, Ellen had not the gift of self-expression,
and cordiality from another
seemed to freeze her up. It was this trait
of her character which had made Mrs.
Burton not care for her much at first, and
which kept her from greater intimacy with
the girls, except Alice Ashton, who was not
unlike her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Now, instead of appearing gracious, she
looked annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked you several times not to
mention gratitude,&rdquo; she returned, staring
ahead and turning undeniably red. &ldquo;If I
must tell you the truth, I like it better
here than at our own camp. That is, I like
being useful&mdash;not your camp itself&mdash;there
is no comparison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time her companion showed embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally there is no comparison. My
sister&rsquo;s and my arrangements are of the
simplest and I have no doubt Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s
camp leaves nothing to be desired. That
is one of the causes of my gratitude. I am
afraid we have not been able to make you
comfortable, though there is little doubt of
what you have done for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Clark glanced around his own
quarters. Even outdoors there was a
pleasanter sense of order and comfort. An
outdoor camp can be made the most disorderly
place in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>This morning the fire was burning in the
right place so that the smoke blew away
from the two tents&mdash;not toward them.
There was no litter of paper and of cans;
no broken sticks cluttering the ground.
The wood was neatly piled; the very earth
itself appeared to have been swept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would eat your breakfast,&rdquo;
Ellen replied curtly.</p>
<p>Then she watched her companion so
carefully there was no mistaking her interest,
even if her manners were somewhat abrupt.</p>
<p>However, her companion was not in the
slightest degree offended. In some way he
seemed to understand Ellen&rsquo;s curtness and
her domineering attitude. Perhaps, if she
had cared more for herself she would have
tried to make herself more agreeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll go back as soon as Marta
is strong enough to take proper care of you,&rdquo;
she announced a few moments later as she
arose to take away the empty breakfast
dishes. &ldquo;I know my being here makes the
place more crowded, but I really would like
to stay a few days longer and let Marta have
a good time. She is better now and can get
about after a fashion, and the Camp Fire
girls want her to go on a few of their
excursions. Mrs. Burton has taken a
fancy to her, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then Marta will be in a seventh heaven.
Only, I hope Mrs. Burton will get the
nonsense out of her head that she wishes
to be an actress. I am afraid, however,
just the sight of her may have the opposite
effect. You see, Marta and I used to plan
to set the world on fire. Most youthful
persons do, I was to be a great author and
she a great actress. You see what our
plans have come to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s tone was utterly
despondent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing at all except that you are
ill and have come out to Arizona to get well.
You have been here a year and I presume
you are already better.&rdquo; There was not
the least trace of sympathy in Ellen&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for being a great author, you seem to
write all day as it is; so I don&rsquo;t see how
your illness interferes. I don&rsquo;t suppose
you were becoming famous as a newspaper
reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob Clark sat upright, his whole face
changing, both in color and expression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ellen Deal, you are the best tonic
as well as the best nurse I have ever run
across. I believe I would have a fighting
chance in more ways than one if you were
going to stay in my neighborhood until I do
get well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had spoken spontaneously and without
thinking beforehand. Of course there had
been no serious meaning in his words.</p>
<p>But Ellen continued to stand holding
the tray and looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am seriously considering staying with
you, if you will allow me,&rdquo; she answered
so unexpectedly, that her companion could
only stare at her incredulously. &ldquo;In the
last few days I have decided that there is
no reason why you should not recover if the
right care is taken of you. But I doubt
Marta&rsquo;s ability. She is too untrained and
too undisciplined. I am glad she is to
come into our Camp Fire circle, where she
ought to learn a great deal that will be
valuable for her. But it will take some
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Clark reached up and took the
tray away from Ellen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please sit down again for a moment,&rdquo;
he asked, pointing to the camp chair she
had just occupied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you have just said does me more
good than you imagine. My sister and
I haven&rsquo;t many friends; we have always
been poor, and an ancestry that has not
made good in the last generation does not
count for much nowaday&mdash;not even in the
South. Then, you are very kind to try to
brace me up; but a fellow is a quitter who
breaks down in his early twenties and has
to live on the money a few friends and
relations furnish him and his sister. So
you see, even if I would give my right hand
to have you remain with us until you get
really tired, why we just can&rsquo;t afford it.
A nurse like you. Miss Deal, is a luxury
no man is rich enough to deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Ellen had sat down as her
companion requested, she did not seem to
be paying much attention to his words.
But, at the last sentence, she frowned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd. Of course, I know
you can&rsquo;t afford the expense of a trained
nurse or you would have had one. You
haven&rsquo;t even a cook, and a cook may be
more important than a nurse in your
present condition. But I know how to
cook as well as nurse. I have known ever
since I was a little girl. New England girls
are brought up sensibly. And I am not a
trained nurse. At least I am not a graduate.
I have simply been staying out here in the
West as a guest of Mrs. Burton until I got
over a slight breakdown. There was
nothing the matter with me but being tired,
and I feel splendid now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen stopped a moment and seemed to
be thinking deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t let me stay
here for a while with you and your sister
without paying me. I have accepted Mrs.
Burton&rsquo;s hospitality when I didn&rsquo;t even
know her. I thought I might be useful in
case any of the Camp Fire girls were ill, but
they keep perfectly well. I think I am
tired being idle, and I have money enough
to pay my share of expenses with you.
They cannot be much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen was tactless.</p>
<p>Robert Clark was a Southerner and
shrank from a discussion of money matters
at all times. Ellen&rsquo;s speech had touched
him where his nerves were raw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, very much, but your suggestion
is entirely out of the question,&rdquo;
he answered coldly. He had a sensitive,
well-bred face, made more so by illness.
Now his manner showed a hauteur of which
he was wholly unconscious.</p>
<p>Ellen felt strangely ill at ease. She had
a sensation of shrinking, of shriveling up,
inside her. Then, to her intense anger,
her eyes filled with tears. She hated
herself for having hurt her companion and
she hated him for having hurt her. But,
most of all, she was horribly ashamed of her
own tactlessness&mdash;her fashion of making
people dislike her when she had intended
being kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said a little huskily
in spite of her efforts to speak calmly, &ldquo;I
did not mean to force myself upon you and
your sister. Of course you will be happier
alone, and I am sure you will soon be
stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the young man would have
answered could not be known, for just
then Marta came out of her tent. She still
limped a little but was not using a crutch.</p>
<p>Her eccentric, somewhat irregular face
was radiant, and she was wearing her same
best grey-green dress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When do you think the Camp Fire
party will come for me, Miss Deal? You
are an angel to stay here and let me go
on this expedition with them. I am so
happy I would like to dance with one leg,
even if the other is slightly out of commission.
But what is the matter, Rob;
why are you looking so grouchy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marta had come up close to the older
girl and her brother and now surveyed
him severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind Rob, if he is having a
tantrum, Miss Deal. He does now and
then, though I must say he has a better
disposition than I have. If I were you
I would just go away and leave him for a
little while. When he gets lonely he is sure
to behave better. Come with me, won&rsquo;t
you, and let us see if the Camp Fire party
is nearly here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen and Marta moved a few steps
away. They had not gone far before they
heard the old Camp Fire call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wo-he-lo for work, wo-he-lo for health,
wo-he-lo for love.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Canyon</span></span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There is a song in the canyon below me,</p>
<p class="t">And a song in the pines overhead,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">As the sun creeps down from the snow-line</p>
<p class="t">And startles the deer from its bed;</p>
<p class="t0">With mountains of green all around me,</p>
<p class="t">And mountains of white up above,</p>
<p class="t0">And mountains of blue in the distance,</p>
<p class="t">I follow the trail that I love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>When the verse ceased and Peggy
had turned around, there was a
little burst of applause.</p>
<p>The little poem she had just recited was
so perfectly descriptive of the scene surrounding
the Camp Fire party at this
moment that it was almost as if it had been
created for the place and the occasion.</p>
<p>They had come part of the way down
one of the easier trails leading to the Grand
Canyon and had reached a broad, flat
rock like a table-land. On it there was a
growth of scrub pine; way below the deep,
subdued roar of the Colorado River and
beyond the blue, snow-topped hills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Peggy was standing at the edge of the
plateau of rock looking down the trail
which descended lower into the canyon,
when the lines of the song had occurred to
her and she had spoken them aloud.</p>
<p>She was one of a group of half a dozen or
more persons near enough to hear what
she was saying while the others were not far
away in the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is charming, Peggy,&rdquo; Gerry
declared when the applause ended. &ldquo;I do
envy your being able to remember a thing
so delightfully appropriate. I never can
at the right moment. But it isn&rsquo;t like you,
Peggy, to be reciting poetry; one might
have expected it of Bettina. I believe you
are in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke good-naturedly but with a little
teasing inflection that only Gerry had
at her command among the Camp Fire girls.</p>
<p>However, Peggy laughed and shrugged
her shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am in love. I am in love
with the whole world and I never have
been half so much so before in my life. Who
wouldn&rsquo;t be in such a place on such a day
and in such society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy made a slight grimace and bowed
to her assembled friends, but by accident
her gaze rested last on Ralph Marshall&rsquo;s
eyes and she flushed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who of you is going a portion of the
way down the trail with Ralph and me
before lunch?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Mother says
she is willing if we don&rsquo;t go far and are
depressingly careful. I have promised
not to put one foot before the other without
taking thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your mother will trust you to me.
I have asked her consent,&rdquo; Ralph protested.</p>
<p>Gerry and Sally both giggled. Ralph&rsquo;s
speech had been made in good faith and
without the least idea of a double meaning,
but they were apt to be silly and sentimental
on subjects they had better not have
been considering while they were Camp
Fire girls.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Peggy did not even see the
point in their sudden amusement. She
was waiting to have some one except Ralph
Marshall reply to her question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish you would not go, Peggy.
The rest of us are satisfied with this view of
the canyon for today, at least. We did not
plan to go further down,&rdquo; Bettina Graham
protested, looking anxious. &ldquo;I would go
with you if I dared, but you know how I
hate looking down great distances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy laughed. &ldquo;Oh, you are not to
come, &lsquo;Tall Princess.&rsquo; We would not
have you along for a great deal. Remember
what a time we had with you on a much
less difficult trail. But I thought some one
of the others&mdash;&rdquo; She turned toward Sally
and Alice Ashton and their companions,
Terry Benton and Howard Brent.</p>
<p>Terry shook his head, but for some
unknown reason appeared a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not today, Miss Peggy. Under the
circumstances I don&rsquo;t feel I ought to make
the third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peggy paid no attention to Terry
Benton&rsquo;s refusal, because almost immediately
Howard Brent interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am coming along,&rdquo; he announced
brusquely.</p>
<p>Peggy waved her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye; I ought to be safe with two
escorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with Ralph Marshall in front and
Howard Brent behind, the three started
down the second trail.</p>
<p>From the fat plateau of rock a second
trail descended to another ledge below.
The first trail had been gentle and the
Camp Fire party had come down to their
present resting place without difficulty.
But the second trail was a steeper and more
dangerous kind.</p>
<p>It was cut into the side of the rock and
filled with loose stones and gravel. After
the first turn, the rocks on the one side
rose up almost perpendicularly and
descended with equal abruptness on the
other.</p>
<p>There were other trails deeper and deeper,
down toward the bottom of the canyon,
but these Peggy had promised not to
attempt. However, they would have taken
too long a time to follow and would have
required the service of a guide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>But this particular strata of rocks was
still in what is known as the limestone
formation. Now and then blocks of blood
red showed through the scrubby patches of
underbrush, and then there would be a line
of grey sandstone, so that the red and grey
looked like alternating ribbons.</p>
<p>Twenty feet below the starting place the
little party of three stopped to wave to the
group above them. They had previously
come down through the white wall of stone
which now rose like a mountain of snow
above them.</p>
<p>Bettina, from her place up above, could
not see Peggy&rsquo;s face, but for two or three
moments after they started down again she
could see her figure.</p>
<p>Peggy moved with swift and certain
grace. She seemed as totally unafraid and
as sure of herself as her two companions.
Indeed, she appeared rather more so, for
there are persons with whom the art of
climbing is a natural gift, and others who
are extraordinarily awkward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Ralph Marshall was in front although
it was an unfortunate place for him. The
rocky path was deeper than he had expected,
and the stones under his feet slipped more
uncertainly. The experience of descending
so steep a precipice was a new and not
altogether a pleasant experience. Ralph
had not dreamed that one could be expected
to walk down the face of a rock, but that
was apparently what the three of them
had set about doing.</p>
<p>Yet neither Peggy nor Howard Brent
made any complaint.</p>
<p>Now and then Ralph could hear Peggy
laugh as she slipped and regained her
balance.</p>
<p>But he had no disposition to laugh.
Once or twice he thought of asking Howard
Brent to exchange places with him and
lead the way. They had not planned to
follow this second trail for any great
distance, but only to come down a short
way until they discovered a possible resting
place where the view of the lower walls of
rock and the river would be finer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Yet Ralph hesitated to speak to Howard
Brent. They were not friendly. Indeed,
Howard had avoided his society as much
as possible ever since the unfortunate conversation
he had held with Terry Benton
in reference to Peggy. Moreover, Ralph
knew that Howard was also scornful of him
in other ways. He was so strong and
efficient himself in outdoor matters that
he considered the Eastern man almost
effeminate. It was true Ralph could dance
and play tennis, but he was not athletic,
because he never had been fond of really
strenuous sports. They had always
appeared too much like work.</p>
<p>Ralph now felt that he would rather come
to grief than confess his nervousness to the
other man. Peggy, he would not have
minded. She was never disagreeable when
people did not enjoy exactly the same
things she did.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ralph was becoming convinced
that Peggy Webster was one of the finest
girls he had ever known. He had set about
trying to be particularly friendly with her
because of his wager. But, if he had not
succeeded in making Peggy like him by his
attentions to her, he had certainly succeeded
in making himself fond of Peggy. He had
no sentimental ideas about her, as he had
about many girls with whom he indulged
in mild flirtations. For one thing Peggy
seemed too young; for another, she was
too boyish and too frank in her acceptance
of his comradeship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Personally, Ralph considered that so far
he had lost his wager. Peggy Webster
did not care for him in the way he had
announced he could influence her to care.
But he had never again mentioned the
matter of his bet with Terry Benton, not
feeling proud of it. However, he had still
continued to devote himself to Peggy, and
ostensibly for the reason he had given his
two companions about ten days before.</p>
<p>But, now, sliding down among the rocks,
Ralph&rsquo;s thought was undeniably fixed upon
himself. He was hoping to get out of an
uncomfortable position without loss to his
own dignity. He would like to have gone
back to their original resting place and
rejoined the rest of the Camp Fire party
without descending another yard deeper
into the rocky bed of the earth. But the
thing was impossible and he made the
best of it. Ralph Marshall was lazy, but
he was not a coward. Moreover, there was
no spot where one could stop and turn back.
His hope lay ahead. Once they reached
a flat place, he meant to suggest returning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Two or three times Ralph felt dizzy.
He had not dreamed of such weakness in
himself and would not give way to it.</p>
<p>Then he felt the dizziness coming on
again. This time he did not care. There&mdash;just
a few feet beyond&mdash;their trail widened
and a ledge of rock jutted out over the
precipice on their left side.</p>
<p>Here, at least, was a spot large enough
to rest upon and to get one&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<p>Peggy Webster was perhaps only three
feet behind Ralph when he made his discovery.</p>
<p>He walked on to the ledge of rock, beckoning
her to follow. As the flattened
surface was so small, he was forced to go
close to the edge in order to make room
for her.</p>
<p>And Peggy did follow him. She was
standing only a few inches away when
the rock Ralph was on crumbled.</p>
<p>His reaching out and seizing her as
he fell was not cowardly&mdash;it was only
instinctive.</p>
<p>He went over backwards, but she was
facing him and was able to keep her footing
an instant longer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>However, it was only an instant because,
as Howard Brent saw them, Ralph and
Peggy appeared to slip over the side of the
precipice together.</p>
<p>Howard was a few yards further back,
yet in the briefest possible time he had
dropped flat on his hands and knees and
crawled out on the crumbling ledge.</p>
<p>There had been no outcry except Ralph&rsquo;s
first exclamation of horror. But, how
far down they had fallen, Howard Brent
could not discover until he, too, was able
to look over the side of the cliff.</p>
<p>Then he discovered that Peggy was only
a few feet below, and that Ralph Marshall
was just beneath her. But Ralph had
released his clutch&mdash;it was Peggy Webster
who was clinging tenaciously to him. She
had managed to get one hand inside his
coat, so that she was holding Ralph suspended
as if he had been a wooden image.</p>
<p>This would not have been possible except
for the fact that Peggy&rsquo;s other arm was
wound about a small tree, growing upright
among the rocks as serenely as if it had
been planted in the earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>As the girl slid down, this tree had been
directly in her way, so that it was intuitive
to seize hold on it. The strange fact was
that Ralph Marshall had not made the
same effort as he went past. But the
truth was, the back of Ralph&rsquo;s head had
struck a heavy stone as he went over and
he had almost at once lost consciousness.
Yet his weight was not altogether held up
by Peggy. Fortunately, a rock jutting out
from below gave a kind of resting place.
But Peggy had to keep his body in position.
When she let go Ralph must fall face
forward.</p>
<p>And Peggy could not hold on much longer.</p>
<p>Howard Brent realized that he must do
something at once. Yet what was he to do?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Man From Above</span></span></h2>
<p>There are times when circumstances
act in one&rsquo;s favor with surprising
quickness.</p>
<p>Howard Brent had scarcely a moment
of wondering whether it were humanly
possible that he could trust himself to crawl
downward over the crumbling rock and
reach his companions. By this method he
might rescue Peggy, but not Ralph. He
could not, of course, pull them both up
together, the moment Peggy released
her hold Ralph had no chance.</p>
<p>Howard simply did not consider the
saving of Ralph first.</p>
<p>But he did turn his head to look up the
trail for help, and he did call out as loudly
as possible. They were not so far down,
that some one of the Camp Fire party might
not hear him. The chance was a slim one,
yet every desperate chance must be taken.</p>
<p>Howard was greatly surprised when his
call was immediately answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>The next instant there appeared above
him the wise grey head of a small burro, with
a long-legged man seated on his back.
But, best of all, the burro had a rope
thrown carelessly about his neck.</p>
<p>The man and the burro did look as if they
represented a special act of Providence, but
the reason for their sudden appearance was
a very simple one indeed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton had not known of Peggy&rsquo;s
and Ralph&rsquo;s intention to go on farther
down the trail, until five or ten minutes
after their disappearance with Howard
Brent, when Bettina came to her and mentioned
the fact. Mrs. Burton had been
occupied with other things and, after the
safe arrival of the Camp Fire party on this
plateau of rock where they were to spend
the day, had gone away from the others
and laid down for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Indeed, her eyes were closed and she was
half asleep when Bettina found her. But
Bettina was too uneasy not to confide in
her at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton immediately shared Bettina&rsquo;s
anxiety. If Mrs. Webster had given
her consent, it was because she knew
nothing of the dangers of the rocky trails
and Peggy had clouded her judgment.</p>
<p>But she did not go to her sister. It was
Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s idea, as it had always been
Polly O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s, that Mollie should be
spared whenever possible. So she found
one of their guides and sent him on down
the trail after the wanderers as quickly as
he could be started.</p>
<p>The burro was to save Peggy the fatigue
and danger of the ascent, and the rope was
merely a safeguard in case one of the two
young men should slip.</p>
<p>The guide was down by Howard Brent
and had his rope coiled like a lasso in an
incredibly short time. He had been a
ranchman and the art was entirely familiar
to him.</p>
<p>A moment later it was safely around
Ralph&rsquo;s body and Peggy was able to let go,
while the two men drew Ralph up to safety.</p>
<p>It was curious but it seemed more difficult
for Peggy to hold on after her burden
had been taken from her, than it had been
before. It happens this way in life with
other burdens. She was so stiff and so
tired that her own volition was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>But, something, a something that is
oftentimes stronger than one&rsquo;s will&mdash;an
inherited instinct&mdash;made her continue her
clutch on the small tree.</p>
<p>It was only a brief time. For with the
rope now about his own waist, Howard
Brent soon after crawled down to her.
Holding her in one arm he climbed with
the other using his feet as well and assisted
by the guide from above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="&ldquo;With the Rope Now About His Own Waist, Howard Brent Crawled Down to Her.&rdquo;" width="400" height="711" />
<p class="center"><span class="sc">&ldquo;With the Rope Now About His Own Waist, Howard Brent Crawled Down to Her.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>The two men had simply laid Ralph aside
in a crevice of rock above the trail, as soon
as his rescue had been effected.</p>
<p>He was still unconscious when Peggy
reached safety.</p>
<p>She did not feel frightened about herself&mdash;only
incredibly tired. But Ralph&rsquo;s face
frightened her.</p>
<p>Peggy had never seen any one unconscious
before&mdash;the whiteness and the drawn look
of the nose and mouth were startling.</p>
<p>She went over to him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; she said, shaking him gently.</p>
<p>Then she turned to Howard Brent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Ralph dead?&rdquo; she asked quietly, yet
with a queer note in her voice.</p>
<p>Howard stared at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord, no,&rdquo; he returned, not with
much show of feeling. &ldquo;There is nothing
the matter with Ralph except that he
bumped his head as he went over. He
will be all right in a little while. He was a
good deal of a chump to have gone so near
the edge of the cliff and more of a chump
to have dragged you along with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy did not answer. She knew, of
course, that Ralph had not intended any
harm should befall her, but it was not
worth while arguing the point then.</p>
<p>Instead, she managed to seat herself in a
half upright position, but so she could get
Ralph&rsquo;s head in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; she kept repeating over and
over in a gentle, penetrating voice. She
believed her voice would somehow reach
her companion&rsquo;s consciousness. She had
the control and the sense of having braced
herself to meet an emergency, which was
characteristic of Peggy Webster. But
there was no doubting the depth of her
feeling; nor of how much affection she
felt for her friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>It was there in her face, as well, and
Ralph saw it when he first opened his eyes.
Howard Brent was also a witness. If
Ralph had wished proof that he had won his
wager and had made Peggy Webster care for
him by a few weeks of careless attention, his
proof was undeniable.</p>
<p>Yet Ralph had no thought except gratitude
and admiration. Peggy Webster was
the clearest-eyed, the bravest, and the
truest girl he had ever known in his life.
Ralph remembered his own instinctive
clutch after her and would have given five
years of his life to wipe out the memory.</p>
<p>But Peggy was perfectly sensible and
matter of fact by this time.</p>
<p>In her pocket she had the usual first aid
Camp Fire necessities. Ralph&rsquo;s head was
only cut and not deeply, as far as one could
see. She merely bandaged it until they
could reach the flat table-land above.
There they would find water and whatever
else was required.</p>
<p>In spite of his protest Ralph was made
to ride the burro, with the guide ahead
leading them both, and Howard assisted
Peggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>It was a sorry little party and not impressive.
If Peggy had not been so tired she
would have been amused at the spectacle
they presented, after only about a half an
hour&rsquo;s exploration of the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>But she really did wish to make as light
of the situation as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say a great deal about how
stupid Ralph and I were, Mr. Brent. That
is, let us agree not to tell any more than we
positively must. If mother and my aunt
learn that I pitched over a cliff they will be
so wretched over what might have happened
to me&mdash;and did not&mdash;that it will spoil their
pleasure, and perhaps everybody&rsquo;s. I am
awfully grateful to you,&rdquo; she ended shyly;
&ldquo;of course, we would both have come to
grief without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the guide would have looked after
you, and I was of no value without him,&rdquo;
Howard Brent returned brusquely. He
was in a bad temper and, although he did
not wish to vent it upon Peggy, he found
it almost impossible to conceal his anger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>He never had thought much of Ralph
Marshall and he thought considerably less
of him at present. That a girl like Peggy
Webster should waste her affection upon
him was annoying under any circumstances.
But that she should do so under the particular
conditions which he had heard being
arranged by Ralph and Terry Benton was
unendurable.</p>
<p>Yet Howard had not altogether made up
his mind. He thought Peggy should be
told of their wager and yet had not finally
decided to tell her himself.</p>
<p>It was on the tip of his tongue to tell her
at once, but here was of course neither the
time nor the place. She was such a plucky
little person and looked so used up, although
insisting that she was perfectly fit. Howard
had suggested that he carry her a part of
the way, but Peggy had only laughed at him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the young man felt perfectly
capable of doing it and he probably was.
He was four or five years older than Peggy
Webster and really had believed, ever since
their first meeting, that he would like her
for a friend. He had no sister of his own,
but if he had had one, Howard Brent felt
that he would have been proud to have her
like Peggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>In the last ten days he had been made
wretchedly uncomfortable by her innocent
straightforwardness in accepting Ralph
Marshall&rsquo;s attentions. Therefore, as he
considered the confession must be made,
he might as well meet the situation. Later
in the day when Peggy had rested, Howard
at length concluded he must tell her himself.
There was no one else for the unpleasant
task.</p>
<p>But during their walk up the trail Howard
did but very little talking and Peggy was
grateful. She did wish to appear as self-controlled
and as indifferent to her experience
as she could, before rejoining her
mother and friends. Bettina and her aunt
might be angry as well as alarmed, for she
should not have insisted upon going down
the second trail against Bettina&rsquo;s advice
and her aunt&rsquo;s knowledge.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was considerable
excitement when the three adventurers
returned. And, because of the injury to
his head, all day Howard Brent had to see
Ralph being made more or less a hero of
by the Camp Fire girls.</p>
<p>Peggy was more exhausted from her
experience than she had realized and
remained a great part of time quietly
seated by her mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Mrs. Webster was not entirely comfortable
because she had left Billy at camp
with only Marie for a companion. But he
had insisted that he did not wish to join
the Camp Fire expedition and would not
allow even Vera to stay behind with him.</p>
<p>About four o&rsquo;clock the entire party
started back for camp. They wished to
arrive in time for an early dinner and Marta
Clark had first to be taken home.</p>
<p>Marta, as well as Peggy Webster, felt
that she had not had so satisfactory a day
as she had dreamed of. In the first place,
Mrs. Burton had been so absorbed in the
day&rsquo;s arrangements that she had paid but
little attention to her outside guests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Then, Dan Webster had not been so
agreeable as Marta expected him to be.
Perhaps she had no right to have taken his
interest a little for granted. His past
kindness must have been due to sympathy
caused by her accident, for Dan was
undeniably one of the physically strong
people to whom weakness made an appeal.
Now, as she was a great deal better, she
no longer required his physical assistance.
So today he devoted the most of his time
and attention to Sally Ashton. Sally,
declaring that the grandeur and coldness
of the great stone cliffs made her lonely and
afraid, had appealed to Dan to be with her
whenever he could. So, as Marta had made
no such appeal, she was neglected.</p>
<p>However it was arranged for them that
Dan should drive Marta home in one of the
small carriages and that Peggy was to
accompany them.</p>
<p>By his own request Howard Brent was
allowed to make the fourth and to sit by
Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After dinner, tonight, when you have
rested I should like to speak to you alone
a few minutes,&rdquo; Howard asked unexpectedly,
just before their arrival at Sunrise
camp. &ldquo;Mrs. Burton said I might stay
on until bedtime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">Disillusion</span></span></h2>
<p>For an hour before dinner Peggy
remained alone in her tent, Bettina
having seen that she was comfortable,
had then gone away.</p>
<p>She was annoyed at finding herself so
stiff and sore and for some reason so oddly
depressed. For Peggy was not as accustomed
to depression as most girls, being
too fond of outdoor life and not given to
introspection. But it was natural enough
that the nervous shock, as well as the
physical strain of her recent experience,
should tell on her more as the hours passed
than at the beginning.</p>
<p>Ralph and Terry Benton had gone home
at once to their hotel on the return of the
Camp Fire party to camp.</p>
<p>Through dinner Peggy sat quietly
between her mother and Dan, not talking
very much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>From the other end of the table Howard
Brent watched her furtively whenever he
had the opportunity. He was not happy
over what he was intending to do, although
from his point of view it was the only fair
thing. Peggy ought not to be deceived by
a pretense of friendship into giving her
own sincere affection in return.</p>
<p>Several times the young man had thought
of confiding in Bettina Graham and asking
her to undertake the task of enlightening
Peggy in his stead. Bettina, Howard
realized, did not like Ralph Marshall any
better than he did. But, afterwards, he
had put this thought away from him,
feeling that, as an actual witness to the
wager between Ralph and Terry, his telling
of the story would be more convincing.</p>
<p>As soon as they had gotten up from the
table Peggy joined their only outside guest
that evening. Together they walked away
from the others.</p>
<p>But they did not go very far, as it was
almost dark and turning a good deal
cooler.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Peggy had put on a golden yellow sweater
and, with her hair so closely bound about
her head and her hands in her pockets, she
had again the slightly boyish appearance
characteristic of her.</p>
<p>But Howard Brent did not see this. To
him she looked very young and sweet and
ardent, with a lack both of vanity and self-consciousness
which set her apart from a
good many girls, but only made her more
attractive to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we find a place and sit down?
You can&rsquo;t be feeling fit enough for much
of a walk,&rdquo; Howard suggested.</p>
<p>At first Peggy shook her head, declaring
she was all right, but later they went to a
favorite spot near the foot of the hill and not
far from the small lake. This was a favorite
Camp Fire place, since it was near enough
to have the rest of the Camp Fire party in
sight and yet far enough away for confidences.</p>
<p>Peggy was not particularly interested
in what Howard Brent had to say to her.
He had seemed to be in the act of confiding
something or other whenever they had met
recently. But she had not considered
deeply what the confidence could be, and
really since he had asked her to give him
a few minutes alone, she had not thought
of the matter at all. She was much too
tired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>But Peggy was always friendly and willing
to listen when her friends wished to talk to
her.</p>
<p>She sat now on an overturned log with
Howard Brent on the ground beside her
and facing her.</p>
<p>There was not much light except from
the big camp fire many yards off. The
pine trees and the hill made a rather gloomy
background, and the stars were just struggling
to show through the dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a pretty close shave you had
this afternoon, Miss Peggy,&rdquo; Howard
began. It was awkward&mdash;this beginning
of an awkward conversation, but as well
one way as another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Peggy nodded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t talk about it
tonight, if you don&rsquo;t mind. It is silly, I
know, but the more I think about the accident
the more nervous I become. Why,
I seem to be more afraid now than I actually
was when I was hanging over that wretched
precipice. I suppose, I was too paralyzed
with terror then to realize what had
happened. I just kept thinking that I was
going to hold on to that tree and to Ralph,
and that even if I died I wouldn&rsquo;t let go.
But now I keep having a vision of Ralph
and myself sliding down forever and ever,
with nothing to stop us. It would have
been pretty awful, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy tried to laugh but the effort was
faint-hearted.</p>
<p>Howard Brent frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been about the most
horrible thing I can imagine,&rdquo; he answered
gravely and with just the right amount of
steadying sympathy in his voice. &ldquo;As far
as you are concerned I simply refuse to
think of it. And, even though I don&rsquo;t like
Marshall, there isn&rsquo;t any human being I
dislike enough to care to contemplate such
a fate overtaking him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s lips parted and she flushed a
little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you like Ralph?&rdquo; she asked
quietly, but without any show of anger.
&ldquo;I have seen that you did not like him and
I have been wondering about it lately.
You see, Bettina Graham feels the same
way and usually I have great respect for
Bettina&rsquo;s judgment. But I think she is
mistaken about Ralph. You see, I have
known him for several years, but not very
intimately. He has been coming to our
place in New Hampshire for a part of his
holidays whenever he has liked, as his father
and mine are great friends. Ralph and I
have always been friendly enough, but he
has never paid any particular attention to
me until lately. I suppose I always seemed
pretty young to him and a kind of tomboy.
I really am one, you know, even if I am
nearly grown. So, now, it seems awfully
good of him to be interested in me, and I
like him very much. That is why I think
it is funny you and Bettina don&rsquo;t like him.
I know he wasn&rsquo;t a good student at college
and can&rsquo;t make up his mind what kind of
work he wishes to undertake. But there is
time enough for him to find out later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marshall is a cad,&rdquo; Howard Brent
interrupted. He had not intended to
speak so abruptly, nor to show so much
anger, but Peggy&rsquo;s defense annoyed him.</p>
<p>However, she did not contradict him,
nor reveal any of the petulance at being
overruled, which most people would have
expressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Instead, she looked at her companion
with the clear, level glance he was beginning
to know fairly well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a pretty hard thing to say about
a human being, Mr. Brent. Sometimes I
think it is perhaps the cruelest thing anybody
can ever say about another,&rdquo; she
repeated slowly. &ldquo;You see it really means
everything. A man or a woman who is a
cad is capable of almost any dishonor.
And, worst of all, a cad does not even know
when he is dishonorable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Howard Brent repeated. &ldquo;I
expect that is a pretty good definition of a
cad. You may not think Marshall so bad
as all that, but unfortunately I do.&rdquo; He
stopped a moment, his skin tanned from the
Arizona winds and suns reddening faintly.</p>
<p>No matter how valiantly he had approached
the moment of his confidence to
Peggy Webster, the actual telling was to be
no more agreeable then he had conceived it.</p>
<p>At this instant he hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you owe it to Ralph to tell me
why you think he is a cad,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s hands were clasped quietly in her
lap and she was leaning forward, looking
with earnestness at her companion. But
she did not appear disturbed. She was
sorry that he had so unfortunate a point of
view about Ralph, but she did not feel in
the least danger of being convinced by his
opinion. For Peggy&rsquo;s points of view were
her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is pretty hard to tell,&rdquo; Howard
went on, &ldquo;and you may not think I ought
to tell you. Somehow it does seem impertinent
of me to dare speak of it. But I just
can&rsquo;t stand your being influenced by Ralph
Marshall&rsquo;s attentions to you. The truth
is about ten days or two weeks ago I overheard
him making a bet with Terry Benton.
He insisted that he could influence you to
care for him as easily and in the same way
that other girls do by paying you attention.
He bet Benton a hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard Brent&rsquo;s face stiffened. The
thing sounded even uglier in the telling
than when it had occurred, and he had not
intended that it should.</p>
<p>But Peggy merely stared at him
incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a joke!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Howard Brent shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, even if it were a joke, it strikes
me as being of a not very well-bred kind.
I didn&rsquo;t know how you might feel concerning
it, but I felt that you ought to know. If
you wish to continue friends with Marshall,
now that you know, why of course it is not
my affair. Perhaps girls are all alike!&rdquo;
Howard concluded.</p>
<p>Peggy was still looking at him, surprised,
but not overwhelmed and apparently not
entirely convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow making a bet of that kind
sounds so stupid,&rdquo; she argued&mdash;not so
much with her companion as with the
impressions struggling for first place in her
own mind. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I doubt what you
have told me, Mr. Brent, only that I think
you have made a mistake. Why should
Ralph care enough one way or the other
whether I like him? I am not a very
important person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard Brent got up. &ldquo;If you would
like confirmation of my story you can
speak to Terry Benton,&rdquo; he announced,
looking decidedly angry. &ldquo;Personally, I am
sorry I spoke to you of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>But Peggy had also gotten up and now
put her hand on her companion&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you are not sorry,&rdquo; she returned.
&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t want to speak of what
you have told me to Terry Benton. But
I would like to ask Ralph. Will you tell
him to come over to see me in the morning,
if he is well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Peggy walked back with Howard
Brent to say good night to her mother and
aunt, serenely talking of other things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">Facing the Music</span></span></h2>
<p>Early the next morning Ralph
Marshall walked over to the Sunrise
Camp.</p>
<p>Without any comment or explanation
Howard Brent had delivered, at the breakfast
table an hour before, the message
entrusted to him.</p>
<p>Except for a slight headache Ralph had
entirely recovered from his injury, but he
was fearful that Peggy had suffered more
than she had confessed and, added to the
fact that she had sent for him, was his own
desire to know how she was.</p>
<p>For the time being the unfortunate conversation
he had held with Terry Benton
had entirely passed out of Ralph&rsquo;s mind.
He did think of it occasionally and he was
ashamed of it. If Terry had ever reopened
the subject, Ralph intended cutting him
short by saying that the discussion had been
a mistake, and that he had made a fool of
himself. But, as Terry did not speak,
Ralph had preferred to let the affair drop,
not having sufficient courage to plunge
boldly into the revival of what he wished
to forget.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>This morning he was really only interested
in finding out that Peggy was all right,
and he was deeply and profoundly grateful
to her. It seemed almost impossible that
any girl could have shown so much nerve
and strength. If, in times past, he had
liked girls better who were less athletic,
whose muscles were less hard, who were
altogether more &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; according to
his preconceived ideas, Ralph had humor
enough to realize that his ideal should have
changed since the day before.</p>
<p>Peggy Webster had rested and was busy
with her share of the morning Camp Fire
work when Ralph came into camp. Her
greeting of him was entirely cordial and
friendly. There was nothing in her manner
which might indicate any difference in her
attitude from the evening before. She
was interested to know that he had slept
soundly and that his head was not troubling
him. He had seen the hotel doctor who
had advised him to pay no further attention
to a slight wound which would quickly heal
of itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>It was also Peggy who proposed that they
take a walk together after she had finished
her tasks. Half an hour later they started
off in apparently perfect accord.</p>
<p>Peggy had insisted, both to her mother
and aunt, as well as to Ralph Marshall, that
she had almost forgotten any discomfort
she may have suffered the previous evening
and was certainly not too tired for a walk.
Indeed, she believed that, getting away from
camp and so much talk of a disaster that
had almost happened, would be good for her.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ralph Marshall was naturally
unprepared for what inevitably followed.</p>
<p>It was not that Peggy was acting to
deceive him or any one else. She had almost
tragically little ability for playing any
part that was not essentially straightforward
and truthful. But, after she had
gone to bed, in thinking over what Howard
Brent had told her, Peggy had become more
convinced than ever that he had in some
way made a mistake. She simply did not
believe that Ralph Marshall could have
made a wager in regard to winning her
friendship. Whatever weaknesses of character
he might possess, he had always been
well bred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Perhaps Peggy had old-fashioned ideas.
There was a kind of simplicity about her
which made her seem younger than she
actually was. But she had gotten some of
these ideas from her father, who had the
old-time courtesy and respect for women,
in spite of the fact that he belonged to the
new generation. Peggy knew that he
felt a man should never talk of a woman
with other men in any way that would
reflect upon her, however little he might
respect or like the woman.</p>
<p>Just for a moment it flashed through
Peggy&rsquo;s mind to reflect how angry her father
would be, if he ever learned that two young
men had actually made a bet concerning
her&mdash;and one through which her dignity
and self-respect must suffer. Then she put
the thought away from her as unworthy of
consideration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>During the first part of their walk, Peggy
made no reference to the reason she had had
for having asked Ralph to come over to see
her so soon after their farewell the evening
before. Indeed, she had almost forgotten
the reason herself, although always the
consciousness of it was lurking at the back
of her brain.</p>
<p>But she and Ralph enjoyed walking
together. There never was a lovelier place
than among these tall pine forests with the
trails cut between the trees, and leading
into unexpected and open vistas.</p>
<p>Ralph had a charming voice and, when
he and Peggy were walking in single file and
not talking, he sang for her amusement.
He seemed to have been to every light opera
that had been produced in the last five
years, and knew at least one or two songs
from each of them. As Peggy lived in the
country and had heard but few, she was
greatly entertained.</p>
<p>It was Ralph who finally suggested that
they rest.</p>
<p>But it was Peggy who chose the somewhat
extraordinary place.</p>
<p>There was a particularly large pine tree
at the edge of an open space. It had long
branches which swung out, like comfortable
hammocks, not far above the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Peggy climbed into one of them and sat
with her feet curled up under her in an odd
fashion, with her back resting against the
trunk of the tree.</p>
<p>Ralph sat nearer the end so that his
weight bore the branch down almost to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy, you look like a tree nymph, or an
elf, or whatever wood spirit is supposed to
inhabit a tree. I am not well up on tree-ology,
or anything else,&rdquo; Ralph said good
humoredly. &ldquo;But you are so dark and
your eyes and hair and skin are so brown.
Besides somehow you have an altogether,
outdoor look about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy laughed. &ldquo;Do you mean that for
a compliment, Ralph? Because, of course,
I understand that translated your speech
simply means I am tanned until I look like
an Indian, or something else not completely
civilised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Peggy&rsquo;s expression changed and
she actually flushed scarlet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is something I want to ask you,
Ralph, though now that I have the chance
I had much rather not. You see, I realize
that it isn&rsquo;t true, but I owe it to you to be
able to tell Howard Brent so. You didn&rsquo;t
make a bet with Terry Benton about me,
did you? You didn&rsquo;t say you would win
my friendship by being attentive to me,
just for the sake of a wager? My friendship
really isn&rsquo;t valuable enough, and in any
case you could have had it without taking
that much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because Ralph did not answer at once,
Peggy bent over toward him from her higher
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Ralph; naturally you are
angry with me; but I didn&rsquo;t believe the
story for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph returned the girl&rsquo;s look steadily.
The expression of his face had never been
stronger. His old expression of laughing
good nature and plastic content with himself
and circumstances at least temporarily
disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true though, Peggy,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;although I would give a good deal to be
able to tell you it was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his reply, Peggy continued to
look puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t understand any reason,&rdquo;
she protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Ralph shook his head. &ldquo;Of course you
can&rsquo;t, and there isn&rsquo;t any. In an idiotic
moment I simply said a very stupid thing
to Terry Benton without realizing just
how ugly and ill-mannered it was. Ever
since I have been trying my best to forget
I ever said it. You are the one person in
the world whom I would rather not have
brought into such a discussion, and to find
that out is a part of my punishment. I
wonder if you can believe, Peggy, how
sorry and ashamed I am, and have been
ever since I made a foolish wager which I
regretted the moment after I had gotten into
it. You are such a clean, straightforward
person, Peggy, I don&rsquo;t suppose you can
even imagine how a human being can do
an ugly thing and yet not be altogether
horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph was talking like a boy, forgetting
that he was a number of years older than
his companion.</p>
<p>But Peggy&rsquo;s eyes had changed their
expression and were no longer puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I might, be willing to accept your point
of view, Ralph, if, after you had made the
wager in which I was to be a victim to your
vanity, you had paid no attention to me.
But I can&rsquo;t forget that it was afterwards
you began being agreeable to me, asking
me to take walks and to dance with you.
If you did not care about winning your
wager, why did you not continue to politely
ignore me, as you had always done? Well
you were successful enough, because I did
like you very much until now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s cheeks were scarlet and yet she
could be nothing but truthful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a dreadful temper and I am so
angry with you now, I feel as if I never wish
to see or speak to you again. Please let me
go back to camp alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he answered
quietly, &ldquo;but I will not trouble you along
the way&mdash;not even by asking your forgiveness.
Some day, perhaps, I may be able
to prove to you how truly sorry I am. Now
I can&rsquo;t even pretend that I have any more
right to your friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">Expiation</span></span></h2>
<p>A few days later the Camp Fire guardian
drove over to the hotel nearby,
accompanied only by Mr. Jefferson
Simpson.</p>
<p>Bettina had offered to go with her, but
she had announced that she preferred going
alone.</p>
<p>This was curious because the one thing
Mrs. Burton had made a point of, ever
since the arrival of her Camp Fire party in
Arizona, was that she be allowed to remain
as inconspicuous as possible. And, if she
wished nobody to find out who she was, she
had certainly to remain in obscurity.</p>
<p>To appear at a fashionable hotel filled
with Eastern tourists was to proclaim her
identity, since the greater number of them
would assuredly be familiar with her appearance,
knowing her by reputation if not
having actually seen her act.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>But Mrs. Burton was too worried to
consider small, personal annoyances. Then
she had a fashion of acting suddenly, having
no very great patience with the things that
displeased her.</p>
<p>For the last few days the atmosphere
of the Sunrise camp had not been an
agreeable one. However, the trouble was
not with the Camp Fire girls, they being
only incidental; the difficulty was a family
one, which is of all varieties the most trying.
And Mrs. Burton had been away from her
own family so much of the time that she
had almost forgotten how wrought up one
can become over comparatively small
matters, when they affect one&rsquo;s own people.</p>
<p>In the first place, for several days Peggy
Webster had been entirely unlike herself,
without giving the least reason for her
sudden change from her natural buoyancy
to a condition of gravity and depression.</p>
<p>More annoying, she insisted that she was
not depressed. When Mrs. Burton and
Bettina frankly told her that they did not
believe her assertion; nevertheless she
would take neither one of them into her
confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Afterwards when Mrs. Burton insisted
that Peggy was not well and must have
suffered from her fall and so should see a
doctor, Peggy flatly declined to see one.
However, Peggy&rsquo;s refusal did not affect her
aunt.</p>
<p>One of the errands which brought her to
the hotel was to call upon the hotel physician
and make an appointment with him to
come over to their camp.</p>
<p>Personally, Mrs. Burton was hurt by
Peggy&rsquo;s behavior. She cared for Peggy
more than for anybody in the world, except
her husband and sister and perhaps her
beloved girlhood friend, Betty Graham.</p>
<p>If anything troubled Peggy, either
mentally or physically, her aunt did not
understand why she would not confide in
her. Ordinarily they understood each
other perfectly, so that even when they disagreed
and had small fallings out, their
estrangements never lasted more than an
hour or so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>But the expression in her niece&rsquo;s face
had recently troubled Polly Burton. She
could not endure the thought of Peggy
being ill or unhappy. If there was anything
in the world that Peggy desired, which she
could possibly obtain for her, she would
have traveled to the end of the world to
secure it. And this Peggy knew. Nevertheless
she had been going about camp for
the last few days doing her ordinary tasks,
walking and driving with the other girls,
but always with an expression that was not
Peggy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Instead of her usual, frank, clear look
of happiness and good comradeship, she
had a hurt, almost an abashed expression,
as if life had somehow suddenly made her
feel less sure of its justice and sincerity.</p>
<p>Yet, there was no trouble between Peggy
and any one of the Camp Fire girls. Besides
being more generally popular than any
other member of the group, Bettina had
made every effort to discover if a difficulty
had arisen and could find no trace of one.</p>
<p>Over the other family matter which was
disturbing both her mother and aunt,
Peggy could not be worrying, because she
had scolded and laughed at both of them,
insisting that they were making too much
of nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Billy&rsquo;s affairs were always involved in
more or less mystery, and Billy adored
mystery. The fact that he was disappearing
every day and refusing to tell any one
where he went, or what he was doing, did
not make any particular impression upon
his sister. Peggy really believed that
Billy on most occasions behaved in this
fashion in order to create an excitement of
which he could be the center.</p>
<p>However, this time at least, his mother
and aunt were under a different impression.
Mrs. Webster was nearly sick with annoyance
and anxiety over Billy&rsquo;s obstinacy and
what she considered his reckless behavior.</p>
<p>After being an invalid for several months
and refusing to exert himself in order to
regain his strength, he had suddenly
announced that he was entirely well and
able to do whatever he wished. At present
this consisted on going away from Sunrise
camp early each morning and often not
returning until bedtime. When he did
come in he was usually exhausted, but he
must have recovered during the night, since
he was able to start out again next day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Nevertheless, Billy looked very frail and
young, and whatever his mother may have
felt, Mrs. Burton had wished a number of
times lately that he was small enough to
lock up in a dark bedroom, like a wilful
small boy.</p>
<p>She did not happen to possess a dark
bedroom at camp, but then facts never
interfered with the sweep of Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s
imagination.</p>
<p>She had talked to Billy a number of
times, begging and commanding him not to
continue to worry his mother and at least
to tell her where he was spending his time.
But, although Billy was very sweet and
apologetic, begging them both not to be
uncomfortable over him, and saying that
he would certainly tell what he was doing
if he could, he did not take anybody into
his confidence, nor did he cease to make
daily disappearances.</p>
<p>Even Vera Lageloff was not told of his
plans, and if she had any suspicion, she
must have been pledged to silence, since
she never mentioned it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Today, as Mr. Simpson stopped her
carriage in front of the great hotel, Mrs.
Burton had about reached the conclusion
that she was not so unhappy over having
no children of her own, as she had always
believed herself to be. However, if she was
going to take her nephews and niece so
seriously, after all what was she being
spared?</p>
<p>So far as Peggy was concerned she was
unhappy over her, but not angry. No one
could be seriously angry for long with
Peggy. But, with Billy, Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s
point of view was a totally different one.
He was too young to be a law unto himself,
if there was ever an age when one had the
right to be. Personally she had no idea of
enduring his obstinate attitude, or being
responsible for what he might be doing.</p>
<p>There was one person whose authority
Billy would be obliged to respect, and that
was his father&rsquo;s. Mrs. Burton had not
mentioned her intention to her sister, but
she was now on her way to telegraph him.
Would he come to them, or was Billy to be
sent home?</p>
<p>In spite of her absorption in family
affairs she was annoyed, as she approached
the hotel, to find the front veranda crowded
with tourists.</p>
<p>If only she could make way through
them without being observed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Certainly Polly Burton appreciated the
fact that she was neither a very beautiful
or impressive person to behold, and that,
except for her reputation as a celebrated
actress, she would never be annoyed with
undue observation. But one had to take
into consideration the fact that one&rsquo;s face
had appeared on billboards in nearly every
large city in the country and that people
were not blind and also possessed memories.
Moreover, although Mrs. Burton was not
herself aware of it, the power of her personality
and great gift were evident in her
appearance. If one looked at her closely
she would hold your interest and attention
as no statuesquely beautiful person ever
could.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton was dressed quietly in a
brown cloth suit, such as any traveler
would have worn. Nevertheless she saw
people staring and heard them whispering
to one another as she walked up on the
porch.</p>
<p>The next instant a young man came
toward her. It was Ralph Marshall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you, Mrs.
Burton?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Polly nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; do get me out of this crowd and
into a quiet place where I can attend to
some things I have come here for, before
anybody speaks to me,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;I
have so much on my mind at present that
if I am asked to behave like a distinguished
character should, even for an instant, I
am sure to disgrace myself and my profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment she and Ralph had
found a small, deserted parlor toward the
back of the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything more I can do to be of
service?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton looked relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Ralph, there are several
things, if you are not too busy to give me
some of your time,&rdquo; she returned.</p>
<p>Ralph shook his head. &ldquo;No; I am not
busy,&rdquo; he answered, with an inflection the
older woman did not notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will you find the hotel physician
for me. Peggy isn&rsquo;t well and I wish him to
come over to see her at the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>For a moment Ralph Marshall hesitated
and seemed about to say something, but
instead turned and walked slowly out of the
room. At the door, however, he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out and be back in a few
moments,&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>He remained away longer, but Mrs.
Burton was hardly aware of it. She was
thinking too deeply. Now, that she had
arrived at the door of her decision and was
ready to open it, she had half an idea of
turning back.</p>
<p>To telegraph her brother-in-law that
Billy was being difficult to handle meant
the end of Billy&rsquo;s stay in the West. And,
like a good many other persons with
tempers, Mrs. Burton was ridiculously
tender hearted.</p>
<p>Billy greatly needed the change of climate
and the life outdoors he had been leading.
He was too frail and was lately growing
into a tall, delicate reed of a boy, as unlike
the ordinary boy as it was possible for one
of them to be.</p>
<p>But, with all his obstinacies and peculiarities
Polly Burton knew that she was more
interested in him than she was in Dan,
who was more satisfactory in every way
and never troublesome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Then suddenly, sitting alone here in the
small hotel parlor, she recalled a circumstance
of her own life. For an entire year
she had made a secret of her own acts,
indeed of her own whereabouts, hiding
the knowledge from her friends and from
her family, excepting only her mother, in
order that she might accomplish her desire
without criticism.</p>
<p>She had wanted to learn to act and had
felt that she could go through the discipline
she needed with a better courage if she
had neither assistance nor advice. And
she had been right.</p>
<p>Now could it be possible that at the
present time Billy was being obstinate and
secretive for some reason which he felt was
justifiable? In all probability he was mistaken;
but, even so, had one not better
allow him a little more liberty? Billy had
done a number of extraordinary things in his
life and also a number of wrong ones; but
to explain them he always had some queer
theory of his own which he had seriously
worked out. He did not act impulsively
and he was as clean and as spiritually
gallant as a seraph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Nevertheless, Mrs. Burton had not
reached a decision when Ralph Marshall
re-entered the room. For there was always
her Sister Mollie&rsquo;s peace of mind to be considered,
and the danger that Billy with his
absurd ideas might get himself into real
trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor will be here to speak to you
in about five minutes, Mrs. Burton, if you
can wait so long,&rdquo; Ralph reported, taking
a chair near her.</p>
<p>He looked so unlike his usual self that,
for the first time since their meeting, his
companion&rsquo;s attention was arrested.</p>
<p>Ordinarily Ralph Marshall had a debonair
air of self-satisfaction and happiness, as if
he were pleased with himself and with the
world&rsquo;s pleasure in him&mdash;at least his own
world, for few of us ever think far beyond
it. He was not disagreeable or half so
inane as this idea suggests. For the facts
were that Ralph Marshall was handsome,
charming, and extremely rich. He had
always had everything he wished without
making the least effort to obtain it. People
had always seemed to like him, and girls
and women had undeniably spoiled him.
So it was not extraordinary that he had a
fairly amiable opinion of himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>However, today Ralph&rsquo;s face wore
another expression; instead of appearing
pleased he looked extremely out of sorts
with himself, and with everything and
everybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Peggy very ill?&rdquo; he asked, endeavoring
to speak with careless politeness, but
finding himself coloring as he put the conventional
question.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; Peggy says there is nothing the
matter, and perhaps she is right. It is only
that I am absurdly uneasy when there is
the least change in her. Recently she has
not looked very well and has not been so
agreeable as she ordinarily is. There does
not seem anything else I think of as an
explanation, except that she is ill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Ralph did not flush a second time, but
instead had an unexpected sense of well being.
At least he had been right in his estimate of
Peggy Webster. Whatever he might be
himself she was the real thing. Evidently
not a word of betrayal of him and his treatment
of her had passed her lips. Peggy
knew that he valued Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s and her
mother&rsquo;s friendship, and that he would
have been placed in an uncomfortable position
with his own family, if they had ceased
their friendly attitude toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you, Ralph?&rdquo;
Mrs. Burton inquired unexpectedly.</p>
<p>This was his opportunity, nevertheless
Ralph evaded it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have had a disagreeable letter from
the governor,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Every once
and a while father gets down on me and
writes that he will cast me off with the
proverbial penny, if I don&rsquo;t find out what
kind of work I want to do and start at it.
Sometimes it isn&rsquo;t an easy job to be the
only son of a self-made man. When a man
thinks he has made himself he is apt to
think he can make everybody else do his
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hate the thought of work so
much, Ralph?&rdquo; Mrs. Burton queried.</p>
<p>She did not speak in a disagreeable
fashion, merely in a questioning one.</p>
<p>And Ralph Marshall found himself fascinated,
watching the color and warmth in
her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know I am awfully sorry for
people who feel in that way. I don&rsquo;t suppose
you can realize this while you are
young, but, as one grows older, doing one&rsquo;s
work is half the joy of living. Still, I don&rsquo;t
mean to preach. I believe the girls say, the
fact that I don&rsquo;t is my chief value as a
Camp Fire guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would preach to me,&rdquo; Ralph
answered, &ldquo;or at least let me talk to you.
Because a fellow does not say anything, you
need not think he does not realize what a
wonderful person you are! It must be
great to be famous and to know you have
done it all yourself. As for me, it isn&rsquo;t
that I hate work. I don&rsquo;t know anything
about it. The difficulty is getting down to
finding out what I want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly Burton nodded, just as Polly
O&rsquo;Neill would have done, with a quick look
of understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it is hard luck being born
rich, Ralph. But I wouldn&rsquo;t let it be too
much for me, if I were you. Start at anything
that comes your way and afterwards
you&rsquo;ll find the right thing. Do you mind
my quoting something to you? You see it
is my business to repeat what other people
write.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Ralph did not seem to think acquiescence
on his part necessary.</p>
<p>This was the first conversation he had
ever held alone with Mrs. Burton and he
was entirely under the spell of her personal
charm. And yet it seemed extraordinary
to him that so great a personage could be so
simple and unaffected.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton also took his agreement for
granted, for she went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned the verse for Billy&rsquo;s and Dan&rsquo;s
delectation, but I am trying it first on you.
I don&rsquo;t suppose you have read an extraordinary
but uncomfortable book called &lsquo;The
Spoon River Anthology?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton naturally made no effort at
recitation, which, under the circumstances,
would have been ridiculous. She merely
repeated the verse as any one else would
have done, except that it was impossible
for her to change the beautiful quality of
her voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My boy, wherever you are,</p>
<p class="t0">Work for your soul&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p class="t0">That all the clay of you, all the dross of you,</p>
<p class="t0">May yield to the fire of you,</p>
<p class="t0">Till the fire is nothing but light!</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing but light!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>To his amazement Ralph Marshall felt
tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burton, I want to tell you something,&rdquo;
he announced as unexpectedly to
himself as to her.</p>
<p>Then, without attempting in any way to
exonerate himself, Ralph Marshall told the
story of his wager and the effort he had
made to win Peggy&rsquo;s liking, in order to
gratify his own vanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a nice sensation to find you are a
cad, Mrs. Burton, and that the girl you
have more respect and more liking for than
any other you have ever known thinks so
too. Besides, I have recently been informed
of the fact by Howard Brent and, as I
happened to agree with his judgment of me,
I couldn&rsquo;t very well argue the question with
him to my own satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton replied, &ldquo;you
couldn&rsquo;t well argue a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was extremely angry with Ralph
herself as he told his story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>She would have been scornful in any case,
but that he should have chosen Peggy as
his game was a little more than her spirit
could endure.</p>
<p>But a few moments later she was really
sorry for her companion.</p>
<p>Ralph attempted no apology, or excused
himself by extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, Ralph, you need not look as if
you had committed all the crimes in the
calendar. All of us fall from grace now and
then; only, if I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t chose
this kind again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton had risen from her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for that tiresome doctor
any longer. I think I want to send a telegram,
although I am actually not yet sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lips twitched with a slightly whimsical
grimace at herself. But Ralph
Marshall had scarcely noticed her words or
her expression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there is anything I can do
to make up in any way, Mrs. Burton?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t expect Peggy
to have faith in me or care for my friendship
again. But I would like to be of some
service to one of you, principally for my
own self-respect,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But, of
course, there is nothing I can do. I am not
much good because Peggy actually saved
me from falling the other day, when it
should have been the other way round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mn. Burton was thinking quickly, as
she usually did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a favor you can do for me,
Ralph; I have just thought of it,&rdquo; she
answered. &ldquo;I know I can trust you to
keep what you find out a secret, and Peggy
will appreciate it as well. Don&rsquo;t allow
yourself to think that, because you were
capable of doing one ugly thing, you are
capable of continuing to do them. That
impression has ruined many a human being.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My extremely trying nephew, Billy
Webster, has lately turned himself into a
mystery. I think his mother and I have
the right to know where he goes each day
and what he is doing. He refuses to tell us.
If you will find out and not speak of it,
except to me, I don&rsquo;t think it will be playing
unfair with Billy, and it may save us all a
good deal. But I&rsquo;ll try to have a talk with
the young man tonight, to persuade him
to confide in me. In any case will you
come over to camp early in the morning,
Ralph? I won&rsquo;t telegraph&mdash;at least I
won&rsquo;t telegraph today. I&rsquo;ll leave a message
at the desk for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, at this instant, the hotel physician
entered the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Pine, Not the Olive</span></span></h2>
<p>Peggy Webster had her arms
filled with pine branches when she
met Ralph Marshall coming toward
Sunrise camp the following day.</p>
<p>She had gone a short distance into the
woods for some light twigs for the camp
fire, as the supply had gotten low.</p>
<p>She was walking with her head thrown
back to keep the pine needles from touching
her face, although their fragrance always
thrilled her. They were so spicy, so woodsy,
so redolent of a fine sweetness that had no
cloying element in it. Surely the pine was a
wise choice for the Camp Fire emblem. If
a girl can grow into a woman keeping the
same kind of spiritual fragrance that the
pine tree sheds as a physical one, she has no
reason to fear that her value may ever fail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Peggy had not seen Ralph since the
afternoon of his uncomfortable confession
and she had not made up her mind just how
she should meet him. So now her eyes
widened and her lips parted a little; she
was already flushed from the exertion of
her work and the weight of the burden she
carried.</p>
<p>But Peggy spoke naturally enough, as
she would have done to any acquaintance,
although the past sensation of pleasure
she had felt at any chance meeting with
Ralph had gone.</p>
<p>Ralph came forward and quietly extended
his hands for pine branches and, in
spite of the fact that Peggy hesitated, he
took the greater number of them from her.
A few of the twigs broke and fell on the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came over to camp this morning
because Mrs. Burton asked me to come,
Peggy; otherwise I would not have intruded
upon you,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the faintest desire to keep
you away from Sunrise camp, Ralph.
Indeed, I would be sorry if you let me
interfere with your actions in any way.
The other girls like you a great deal and I
am sure would miss seeing you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Ralph did not answer. He had noticed
that Peggy had said &ldquo;other girls,&rdquo; but also
that she had spoken without a pretense
of wishing to impress him with the knowledge
of her disfavor or her change of attitude
toward him. She had spoken with
perfectly unconscious sincerity and Ralph
Marshall appreciated that, for once in his
life at least, he had known a girl who said
what she meant. Peggy&rsquo;s expression &ldquo;other
girls&rdquo; had really been a slip on her part, as
she had not intended bringing herself into
the situation in any way.</p>
<p>At camp they parted, Peggy going to
announce to her aunt that Ralph wished
to see her. And a few moments later Mrs.
Burton appeared.</p>
<p>Ralph had been talking to Gerry and
Sally, while he was forced to wait, and as
they were determinedly planning an
excursion in which he was to take part that
afternoon, he had to be rescued by Mrs.
Burton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>It was never possible to talk with any
privacy in the immediate neighborhood of
the camp. The girls were constantly going
in and out of their tents, rebuilding the
camp fire, or doing any one of a hundred
things in connection with their work or
entertainment. This morning Mrs. Webster
was also sewing in front of the fire, with
Dan coming back and forth to talk to her.</p>
<p>Ralph Marshall did not see Billy Webster,
but, as he had rather a fashion of remaining
alone, this did not mean that he had actually
vanished from camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we walk in the direction of the
cliffs, Ralph,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton suggested and
then, almost as soon as they had started,
she added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Billy has gone; he left before breakfast
this morning so there could be no
chance of a family argument. Dan says
he slipped out of their tent without his
knowing when he departed. And this,
after I had expended an hour of precious
eloquence upon the young man last night,
sitting up with him when everybody else
had gone to bed, and I was abominably
sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton shrugged her shoulders,
expressing amusement and chagrin, as well
as anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I haven&rsquo;t the slightest influence
with him; but, then, no one else has&mdash;or
perhaps I don&rsquo;t know. I asked Vera if
she thought she could influence him and
she assured me she could not. She says my
sister is mistaken in thinking that she
influences Billy; he has always influenced
her, although she is older and infinitely
more sensible. But, Ralph, I only tell you
this about Billy, because I want you to
know something of the character of the
boy you may have to deal with, if you succeed
in doing what I ask of you. I know
you have never noticed Billy particularly;
few people do at first when Dan is around.
Dan is so much better looking and more
agreeable. But Billy is the stronger character
of the two, strange as it seems to all
of us. But whether for good or the other
thing,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton smiled a little ruefully,
&ldquo;I suppose if we live long enough we
may find out. No gentleman could have
been more courteous to me than my nephew
was last night, or more utterly unmoved
by my efforts at persuasion or command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is just one thing we have to rely
on in order to save Billy from what may
turn into a real difficulty. Vera Lageloff
has confided in me that she and Billy one
afternoon discovered a group of objectionable
men. I don&rsquo;t know anything about
them, except that they were on a strike or
something of the kind, and that you and
Peggy had met them by accident a short
time before. But Billy has a passion for
the unfortunate. He had only to hear that
people are up in arms against something
or some one and he is always in the midst of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was curious, but whenever the laborers
on my brother-in-law&rsquo;s place had any
kind of grievance, they first put the matter
up to Billy before taking it to his father.
And you know Mr. Webster well enough to
understand that he is the most just of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton had been walking slowly
along but she now stopped and frowned,
facing her companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why but I am frightened.
I am afraid Billy is mixing himself up in
some difficulty in which he has not the
slightest concern, or the least reason for
taking part in. And Vera is under the
same impression, else she would never have
told me what she did. She says Billy made
her promise not to speak of their excursion,
and she hated breaking her word to him.
But she, too, is nervous about him and
thinks we ought to find out what he is
doing. Of course, we may both be on the
wrong track. The boy may be off amusing
himself somewhere in a perfectly simple
fashion. But if you will only find out,
Ralph, I shall be everlastingly grateful.
I am pretty fond of Billy, though I don&rsquo;t
understand him and he certainly annoys
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph smiled in an entirely efficient and
satisfying manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I expect you take the young man
too seriously, Mrs. Burton. All boys have
cranks of one kind or another, though I
must confess Billy&rsquo;s do not seem to be the
ordinary kind. Don&rsquo;t worry any more; I&rsquo;ll
find him for you and bring him home by the
ear. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean literally; only from
what you have told me I expect the youth
takes himself too seriously. He has been
ill so much he is probably more or less
spoiled. I think the influence of an older
fellow may do him good. I am accustomed
to taking kinks out of the younger boys at
college now and then, when they suffer
from swell heads.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Ralph spoke in a condescending, elderly
brother tone which amused Mrs. Burton,
although she showed no sign of it. Instead,
she gave a little sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please be careful, won&rsquo;t you,
Ralph,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Billy isn&rsquo;t like other
people and he does have to be treated a
little differently. Oh, I know you men
don&rsquo;t think this of each other, and Billy&rsquo;s
father will not consider the idea for a
moment. But I think if he had talked to
Billy more frankly, and asked him to wait
a while before he decided so many questions
for himself, the boy would not be so difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back now, Ralph, as we have
talked over the situation and said as much
as there is to say. I don&rsquo;t suppose you can
do anything immediately; but, if, within
the next few days you make any kind of
discovery, suppose you let me know first.
I really am worried over Billy&rsquo;s realizing
I have tried to spy upon him. I should
have been dreadfully angry with any one
who had done the same thing to me when I
was his unreasonable age.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think Billy will have anything
to complain of,&rdquo; Ralph replied, as if
Billy&rsquo;s attitude held not the slightest interest
for him. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think I need
be forever tracing the young person either&mdash;not
if he has fallen in with the group Peggy
and I met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately, I know where they can be
found if they have not disappeared from
their camping place. But what there can be
in those fellows to interest a youngster, I
can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if your man will lend me a
burro? I walked over from my hotel,
and I think I&rsquo;ll start out on the trail at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph was really interested in his quest.
There was an agreeable element of mystery
in it as well as knight errantry. Besides,
an older fellow is seldom averse to making
a younger one feel small, when he happens
to think it good for him. Moreover, Ralph
had been considerably out of sorts with
himself for several days and it is always
pleasanter to dwell on another&rsquo;s shortcomings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>As soon as Mr. Simpson had allowed him
the use of one of the camp ponies for the
day, Ralph started off at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>After all, it was rather good fun to have
something definite to do, instead of idling
all one&rsquo;s time. And if one was accomplishing
a favor for either Mrs. Burton or Peggy
Webster, why all the more was the effort
worth while. Billy Webster really played
a very small part in Ralph Marshall&rsquo;s
thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Passionate Pilgrim</span></span></h2>
<p>Ralph Marshall&rsquo;s pilgrimage
was in vain. When he reached the
place where the men had been in
hiding, every trace of them had disappeared.
He might have thought that he had made
a mistake in the spot, except that there
were marks on the ground where the camp
fire had been, and he clearly remembered the
circle of small hills.</p>
<p>After remaining in the neighborhood for
half an hour or more and seeing no human
being, Ralph knew that his task was not
to be so easily accomplished. But he had
no inclination to return and loiter about
his hotel. Even failure was better than
boredom, and the last few days had been
intensely dull. Ralph was weary of sightseeing
and seldom took an interest in viewing
things alone. He was no longer friendly
with Terry Benton and Howard Brent,
whose expressed opinions of him had not
been flattering. And, in spite of Peggy&rsquo;s
generosity, he felt himself cut off from the
companionship of the Camp Fire girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Perhaps Ralph did not realize it, but the
fact was that he did not care for the society
of the other girls, now that Peggy&rsquo;s was
denied him.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if it were but slight, an
ambition had been stirred in him by Mrs.
Burton. Actually he wanted to succeed in
what she had asked him to do. Rarely in
his life had he been stirred by this emotion,
except perhaps by the desire to win a game
of tennis, or be elected to some special
college fraternity.</p>
<p>Getting on his burro again, Ralph started
off in another direction. He knew that he
was traveling toward the line of railroad
and supposed he would find more signs
of life there. Certainly he could not discover
less. It was also possible that he
might run across some one who would have
known of the dissatisfied men and might at
least offer a suggestion as to what had
become of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Of course, in finding the strikers one
would not necessarily obtain information
of Billy Webster&rsquo;s proceedings. But, so
long as one was under the impression that
he might be spending his time in their
society, they must first be hunted out.
Afterwards, if Billy were not with them,
then one could pursue some other idea.</p>
<p>After reaching the railroad line, Ralph
jogged along on the road that ran alongside
of it.</p>
<p>The road had been cut through somewhat
more open country, nevertheless he met no
one in passing. At present it was past
noon, but, although Ralph was usually
fond of his own comfort, it had not yet
occurred to him that his prospect for food
was a very poor one.</p>
<p>Then, half an hour later, when he was
not in the least expecting to reach any
such place, Ralph came upon a railroad
station. There was a small frame building
beside a platform and near it a typical
western grocery store, which means that it
held a great many other things beside
groceries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Ralph was feeling tired and a little
hungry. If he was to continue riding about
the country all day in this vague fashion,
it would be as well to secure food for himself
when he could. There was never yet a
country store without cheese and crackers.</p>
<p>Ralph tied his pony to the hitching post
and strolled up to the door of the store.
The door was partly open and he could see
a man inside who was probably a customer,
as he did not appear to be the proprietor,
and was talking with some one.</p>
<p>Ralph walked in and the man stopped
talking. He was smoking a short pipe and
looked curiously at the newcomer. Ralph&rsquo;s
appearance was a surprise. He looked so
exactly like the old-fashioned western
phrase which described the Eastern youth
as a &ldquo;tenderfoot.&rdquo; Ralph&rsquo;s riding costume
was too new, too clean and too fashionable
ever to have seen real service. But he
knew how to make himself acceptable to
most people.</p>
<p>He bowed a curt but friendly nod to the
other man as he moved up toward the
counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a stranger in this part of the
country,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;and I have
been riding all morning. I wonder if you
can let me eat a little something here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>The grocery keeper was friendly enough
and began shoving out the various supplies
that the newcomer had asked for, conscious
of the fact that he was a good customer.</p>
<p>Then Ralph climbed up on a stool and
began eating his lunch and drinking ginger
ale out of the glass bottle. He was enjoying
himself a good deal more than he had at
many a fashionable luncheon served at an
expensive hotel.</p>
<p>By and by he turned to the other man
who had not left the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you would have a bite with
me?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I never did like
having to eat alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated and then came
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care if I do,&rdquo; he answered in a
somewhat surly fashion, but Ralph observed
that he ate hungrily, and they had to have
the supplies renewed a second time.</p>
<p>When they had finished they both strolled
out of the store together and, without any
discussion of the matter, sat down beside
each other on the railroad platform. Each
man looked as if he had no other interest
or occupation in life except just to wait
until a train passed by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much excitement in this
neighborhood, is there?&rdquo; Ralph finally
said.</p>
<p>His companion stared straight ahead of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t sometimes always tell
just by the outside looks of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph hesitated a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been any fun lately?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much; nothing except some fellows
been trying to blow up the track out this
way. I&rsquo;m on the lookout for them for the
railroad, as I&rsquo;m one of the company&rsquo;s men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they and what is the matter?&rdquo;
Ralph asked, trying to show no especial
interest beyond a perfectly natural one.</p>
<p>But his companion showed no sign of
wishing to be secretive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;If I did,
I&rsquo;d have had them out of mischief before
this. There has been a gang of strikers
hanging around somewhere in this neighborhood&mdash;no
one knows the exact place. But
there is no reason for suspecting them,
except that they are down on the company.
Funny, I&rsquo;ve been watching around here for
several days and haven&rsquo;t even run across
anybody to talk to before! At least no one
but a boy who looked like he ought to be
home with his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind of a tenderfoot like I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was a good deal younger than
you. We have so many travelers from the
East out in this neighborhood now, that we
have forgotten to call &rsquo;em &lsquo;tenderfeet.&rsquo;
This boy was a kid&mdash;a real kid&mdash;tall and
sick looking, with light hair and blue eyes
and nice manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny, what was he doing around here?
There is no hotel very near, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for several miles back. The boy
said he was out here for his health and kind
of liked to stay by himself. He said he
would keep his eyes open for me. But he
was a dreamy kind of kid. I don&rsquo;t believe
he would know trouble if he saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he would. Seen him
lately?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This morning early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think he&rsquo;ll come back this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man had refilled his pipe and was
smoking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d I know?&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I
ain&rsquo;t seen him any time, except one or two
mornings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man then got up and stretched
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so long; I can&rsquo;t waste any more
time around here, much as I&rsquo;d like to stay
and talk. I&rsquo;ve got to get up and down the
track a piece. I wish you would keep an
eye open on your way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Ralph answered, &ldquo;only I&rsquo;m
not going back just yet. I am kind of tired
and I thought I&rsquo;d sit here awhile and
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men nodded and the older one
walked away.</p>
<p>Ralph waited for two hours. Then, as
the man in the grocery store was beginning
to look suspicious, he got up and strolled
about. In the meantime the station master
had reappeared, after having spent some
time at his own midday meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Ralph tried to give him the impression
that he was expecting some one on the next
train.</p>
<p>But between four and five o&rsquo;clock his
patience gave out. It was either this, or he
had lost all hope of Billy Webster&rsquo;s returning
the way he had evidently gone, not only this
morning, but on several others.</p>
<p>Ralph then made up his mind to ask Mrs.
Burton to allow him to remain all night
at Sunrise camp.</p>
<p>The wanderer should not disappear the
next day without his seeing him go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">An Appeal</span></span></h2>
<p>It was not particularly difficult as Billy
had not the faintest suspicion that he
was under surveillance. As he had
planned beforehand in his own mind, Ralph
followed him a few moments after his
departure from camp a little after daylight
the next day.</p>
<p>Both rode burros&mdash;the small, sure-footed
ponies, which are used almost
entirely in the western states where difficult
climbing is to be accomplished. And,
except for the pair of mules which were
sometimes hitched to their provision wagon,
the Sunrise Camp Fire party had no other
steeds.</p>
<p>If any were required for their longer
excursions they were rented from the hotel
stables.</p>
<p>This morning Billy got ready his own
burro and Mrs. Burton had asked Mr.
Simpson to have Ralph&rsquo;s waiting in case
he wished it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>The order was an extraordinary one, yet
Mr. Simpson, being one of the wisest of
men, had asked no questions.</p>
<p>Naturally he had been aware of Billy&rsquo;s
daily disappearances, but as nothing was
told him concerning them, he had appeared
comfortably blind.</p>
<p>Now the morning was slightly misty, as
many of the early fall mornings are apt to
be in the neighborhood of the greatest
canyon in the world.</p>
<p>But the mist was colored like an opal as
the sun sifted its warm light slowly through.</p>
<p>Ralph did not attempt to keep the
younger boy in sight. Only now and then
he would send his pony a little more swiftly
forward for a fleeting glimpse of him. He
was, of course, afraid that Billy would hear
him, or that he might suddenly turn around
and see him.</p>
<p>It was not necessary that he constantly
watch the other rider at the beginning of
their travels, as he had a fairly good impression
of the route the younger boy would
take.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Ralph had been a little bored at getting
up so early in the morning, as his outdoor
bed had been extremely comfortable. He
had slept not far away from Billy&rsquo;s and
Dan&rsquo;s own tent, declining the offer of Dan&rsquo;s
cot which he had generously insisted upon
his taking. Therefore, his bed had been a
mattress of balsam and a pair of heavy
Indian blankets.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact this was the first
morning which Ralph Marshall had honored
by arising early since his coming to Arizona.
Now, quite apart from his interest in Billy
Webster&rsquo;s mysterious behavior and his own
desire to be of service, Ralph felt repaid for
his effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great point was to get started at a
thing,&rdquo; he argued with himself. &ldquo;After
that the doing of it wasn&rsquo;t half bad.&rdquo; It
occurred to Ralph that this might be true
of more important issues than the present
one.</p>
<p>There was a possibility that Billy had
only a desire to spend his days in freedom
and adventure. But, if this were true, no
one would have had a reasonable right to
interfere with him. Now, in spite of the
fact that Ralph suggested this idea to himself,
he was not convinced by it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>The tiresome journey of the day before
Ralph was not required to repeat. There
was a more direct route to the track and
from there to the small railroad station.</p>
<p>But, once arriving along the more open
road which ran beside it, Ralph was forced
to keep farther behind.</p>
<p>However, this was unimportant if he
could manage to arrange to have Billy in
sight when he reached the station. After
that, he did not know what direction the
boy would take, as he might continue down
the track or else strike across the country.</p>
<p>Half a mile from the little railroad station
Ralph Marshall&rsquo;s saddle girth suddenly
broke. As the burro he was riding was so
small in comparison with his own height,
Ralph&rsquo;s legs almost reached the ground on
either side of his mount. There was, therefore,
no danger in connection with his
mishap, only there was a short delay. However,
the time consumed was not a matter
of five minutes, required for pulling the
leather straps together and rebuckling them
in a fresh place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Ralph was not seriously concerned,
although having remounted he did ride on
more rapidly than he had since starting out.
But, for some reason he did not again come in
sight of Billy Webster. Arriving at the railroad
station there was still no sign of Billy.</p>
<p>This was puzzling. The pursuer stopped
for reflection. His acquaintance of the day
before was not in evidence, but there was a
chance that the station master, who, at
present, was in his small box, or else the
keeper of the shop, would have seen Billy
go by and noticed what route he had
followed.</p>
<p>Both men declared that no boy had been
seen by either of them during the entire
morning.</p>
<p>Ralph Marshall argued the question.
One or the other of them must have seen
the boy, since undoubtedly a boy had
passed by. But, although argument did not
shake their testimony, it did make the men
angry so that he was finally obliged to desist.</p>
<p>Then, undoubtedly in his own phraseology,
Ralph felt himself up against it.
He simply did not know what to do next.
He must follow Billy, but one cannot well
follow without knowing the plan or the
direction of one&rsquo;s leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>In this life it is the first failures which
are most difficult to endure. Ralph
Marshall had made so few efforts of any
kind in his existence, that he was profoundly
disturbed by this small one.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ralph was at last becoming
affected by Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s obvious nervousness.
Perhaps a successful culmination
of his quest was not so unimportant as he
had previously conceived it. He had wished
to accomplish what he had set out to do,
because Mrs. Burton was uneasy and
because he was anxious to do her a favor.
Incidentally he was not averse to doing
one for Peggy, should conditions develop
in that way. But the question of Billy&rsquo;s
own welfare he had never taken seriously.
Therefore, it was curious that he should find
himself suddenly growing uncomfortable
over the boy.</p>
<p>Well, as one must inevitably go somewhere
in this world&mdash;either forward or
backward&mdash;Ralph appreciated that he could
not remain indefinitely at an entirely uninteresting
and apparently uneventful railroad
station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>So, following an impulse&mdash;not a purpose,
or even an idea&mdash;he rode away from the
station and into the country.</p>
<p>He continued riding the greater part of
the day, feeling as absurd as any foolish
follower of Don Quixote&rsquo;s bent upon an
impossible quest.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ralph did not give up.
He was tired and bored and hungry, and
frequently had to get off his pony in order
to allow it to rest. He found food for his
burro and a little for himself at a small
ranch house, but only now and then did he
came in contact with a human being.</p>
<p>Most of the country through which he
traveled was pine forest. It was ridiculous
to imagine that Billy Webster could have
any interest or any purpose in this unfamiliar
and comparatively uninhabited region.
Yet Ralph could not make up his mind to
return to Sunrise camp bringing back with
him no Billy, no information&mdash;nothing
but a confession of failure.</p>
<p>An hour before twilight, however, Ralph
was forced to start for camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>He carried a compass with him; indeed
he had been using one ever since his arrival
in Arizona, and had been wise enough to
watch the route he had followed with great
care. For the latter part of the afternoon
he had been traveling in a homeward
direction. But now, of course, he must
push straight on without further loitering.</p>
<p>To spend the night in the woods was
entirely feasible, but without covering it
would not be agreeable and nothing would
be accomplished by it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it appears as if one must give
up a desire in this world in order to accomplish
it.</p>
<p>Certainly Ralph Marshall surrendered
all thought of discovering Billy&mdash;at
least on this particular day. He would try
again, however, on the next day and on as
many days as were necessary.</p>
<p>The early dusk had fallen. Ralph was
walking along, leading his burro and fearing
that he had overtaxed its strength, although
these small ponies are supposed to be able
to survive almost any test of endurance.</p>
<p>Then, quite unexpectedly, he heard noises.
They were unmistakably human noises.
Tying his burro to a nearby tree, Ralph
walked cautiously toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>He had not, however, in any way associated
the noises with the success of his own
quest. For, temporarily at least, he had
forgotten Billy, or rather he believed that
the boy must by this time have returned
to Sunrise camp.</p>
<p>The fact which made him most curious
was, that at the present moment he was
not far away from the spot where he and
Peggy Webster had accidentally discovered
the unknown group of men some little time
before. These were the men who were
apparently the strikers on the railroad.</p>
<p>If these were the same men whom he now
overheard, Ralph was not anxious to thrust
himself into their society against their
wishes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless he was amazed when he
finally saw them. Yet the men were the
ones he had expected them to be.</p>
<p>The amazement was due to Billy Webster.</p>
<p>Billy was with them! But not only was
he with them. In spite of his long legs he
had been lifted high in the air and was
seated on the shoulders of two of the
biggest and strongest of the men. And
Billy was making a speech!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>From his hiding place Ralph could catch
a glimpse of the boy&rsquo;s white face in the half
dusk. He could also overhear what Billy
was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you men it won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he argued
persuasively. &ldquo;You know they are on the
look out for you. Haven&rsquo;t I been all up
and down the track for days getting reports
for you? You say your strike has failed
and other men are at work at your old jobs,
but I can&rsquo;t see how it will help you or your
cause to try wrecking the track, or doing
any kind of mischief. Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; His
voice had a high sweetness.</p>
<p>He had leaned over from the men&rsquo;s
shoulders and spoke like a child asking a
favor. Yet the older men were listening
to him with serious faces.</p>
<p>Ralph could not believe what he actually
saw and heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to win some day, if you&rsquo;ll
only have patience; we have all agreed on
that fact,&rdquo; Billy continued, still in his
sweet boy&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Of course it may take
a long time, but it is the biggest fight on
earth, to win justice for the poor; so you
know everybody has got to have a lot of
patience. If you are going to do wrong
things because you think the rich have
done wrong to you, I can&rsquo;t see how you are
any better than they are. And I wouldn&rsquo;t
trust you any more than I do them, once
you get the same power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was occurring to Ralph Marshall, as
he stood absorbedly listening to the youthful
speaker, that Billy Webster was discussing
in a simple, school-boy fashion
certain of the biggest social problems of
the day.</p>
<p>But what most impressed him was not
what Billy said&mdash;almost any clever, visionary
boy might have read the views he
expressed and repeated them parrot fashion.
The extraordinary thing was the way the
men listened.</p>
<p>Actually, by some strange gift of nature,
Billy was a leader among them&mdash;an influence
they respected, even if they would not
follow it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made a mistake with that ugly
piece of work you did the other night,&rdquo; he
went on pleadingly, &ldquo;but no one was hurt
and you have not been found out. Promise
me you&rsquo;ll never do a job like that again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Billy slid down to the ground again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Afterwards Ralph Marshall could see that
he went about from one of the men to the
other, talking, and that in most cases the
men shook their heads. But he could not
hear either what Billy said, or his companion
answered, when they were speaking directly
to each other. It was due to the fact that
Billy had been addressing the group and
that he had been lifted up in the air, that
had made his words audible to Ralph.</p>
<p>Whatever conclusion was finally reached
Ralph eventually realized that the younger
boy was intending to leave for home. For
he solemnly went about and shook hands
with each of the men, as if he were a personal
friend. And, although some of them
received the attention awkwardly, none of
them refused it.</p>
<p>A little later Billy passed Ralph without
observing him. He mounted his pony and
began riding slowly toward Sunrise camp.</p>
<p>In about five minutes Ralph followed, but
he allowed about twenty to elapse before he
rode up alongside the younger boy.</p>
<p>When he did and Billy discovered his
identity, he nodded in his impersonal but
friendly fashion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been on the lookout for me?&rdquo;
he inquired. &ldquo;I had half an idea Tante
would try to discover what I was doing,
when I refused to tell her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t accustomed not to having her
own way. Well, I am glad you did not
run across me today. After this, perhaps,
it won&rsquo;t make much difference if I do give
up my daily disappearances and remain at
camp. I don&rsquo;t think I can have any more
influence as I have said all I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Arrest</span></span></h2>
<p>Three days later Billy Webster
was arrested.</p>
<p>Ralph Marshall was spending
the afternoon at Sunrise camp when the
officers arrived. With them came the man
with whom he had once held a conversation
concerning Billy&mdash;evidently the man who
had thrown suspicion upon him.</p>
<p>It was about three o&rsquo;clock and by chance
the entire Camp Fire party was at home.</p>
<p>Billy, in his favorite fashion, was lying
out in the sunshine on an Indian blanket,
while his mother sat on one side of him,
sewing, and Vera Lageloff on the other,
reading to them both. They had built
themselves a second camp fire in order to
be a little apart from the rest of the group
and not disturb any one by their reading.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>For Mrs. Burton was half reclining in a
big chair outside her tent, looking over a
collection of manuscripts of new plays
which had recently been sent to her by her
husband. One of them he had chosen to
appear in the next season, but he wished
her opinion before finally deciding upon it.</p>
<p>As usual, Peggy Webster was close beside
her aunt, but, in order not to interrupt,
Peggy was engaged in weaving an Indian
basket of sweet smelling prairie grasses.
Ellen Deal was not far away but, although
she held a book in her hand, she was not
reading.</p>
<p>The day before, she had returned from
her voluntary work of caring for the two
invalids. But she did not yet seem to feel
entirely at home in her former surroundings
and, although she had endeavored to conceal
the fact, Mrs. Burton and Peggy had both
observed it.</p>
<p>The other girls were engaged in various
occupations and Dan was having a nap.</p>
<p>Fortunately Ralph Marshall and Sally
Ashton had walked a few yards along the
path which led into Sunrise camp. They
were first to observe the police and the man
who accompanied them, before any member
of the camp fire realized their errand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Ralph had an immediate premonition of
their intention, although he failed to
appreciate its full seriousness.</p>
<p>The man whom he had seen before spoke
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to arrest the kid,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;No wonder you were interested
to hear all I had to say about him. I
was green. I didn&rsquo;t get on to the fact that
you knew him. But, then, I was a long
way from guessing he was mixed up with
this bunch of railroad strikers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently the man did not intend being
impertinent, but was merely stating the
case as he recognized it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Ralph felt both angry and
impotent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know &lsquo;the kid,&rsquo; as you call
him, had anything to do with the strikers,&rdquo;
he inquired. &ldquo;And if he did, what is that
to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, maybe, except that we want
to find out just how deep he was in the
trouble. There were some rails torn up
out of the track last night a few miles from
here and a freight train went over. Lucky
it was a freight, but the engineer was pretty
badly hurt. We&rsquo;ve got a straight tip that
two or three of the strikers did the work.
And we have been hearing that this boy,
who is staying out here in a camp with a
lot of relations and girls, has been loafing
around with these same men, getting news
for them and watching what was going on
in places they couldn&rsquo;t show themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; Ralph returned. He was
thinking quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me the chance to go and
tell the boy&rsquo;s people what you have come
for?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You see his mother is
with him now and there is no telling what
effect your appearance on such an errand
will have on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older of the two police officers
nodded, with an expression of relief. Evidently
he had no taste for the task ahead of
him.</p>
<p>This afternoon Sunrise camp looked like
an idyl. The tents stood in white outline
against the dark background of pine trees.
In the central space before the tents a big
camp fire was burning and seated about it
were three or four girls in their Camp Fire
costumes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>The two other groups were not for away.</p>
<p>Ralph went directly to Mrs. Burton.
He was sorry that Peggy Webster was so
near that she would be obliged to overhear
him, but he dared not delay.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances it was well that
he had given a detailed account to Mrs.
Burton of his discovery of Billy and exactly
what he had overheard him saying.</p>
<p>Billy was not aware of this fact because
his aunt had never mentioned it to him.
Ralph had not had any conversation with
him since their return to camp together a
few evenings before.</p>
<p>Since then, so far as any one knew, Billy
had not been away for an hour.</p>
<p>So, in a measure Mrs. Burton was prepared
for the disagreeable news Ralph
brought her. In any case she was usually
at her best in real difficulties; it was the
smaller ones that found her unprepared.</p>
<p>Now she turned at once to Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, dear, we must explain to your
mother,&rdquo; she remarked quietly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be
frightened. Billy has done nothing wrong,
though he may be compelled to prove the
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Sally had dropped behind before Ralph
delivered his message, but he accompanied
the two women across the few yards of
ground that separated them from Mrs.
Webster.</p>
<p>It was curious, but none of them thought
of Billy&rsquo;s being particularly frightened, and
yet he was a delicate, high-strung boy, not
yet sixteen.</p>
<p>Billy was not frightened. As soon as he
understood what his aunt was saying to his
mother, he got up and came over to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be worried, dearest,&rdquo; he
whispered patting her shoulder softly. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong&mdash;I give you
my word of honor&mdash;not even anything
wrong as you and father look at it. Of
course, you&rsquo;ll think I have been pretty
headstrong and foolish and have gotten
myself into a scrape. But I didn&rsquo;t see it
that way. I thought I could persuade the
men to keep out of trouble. Well, I didn&rsquo;t
succeed, but I did not know I had not until
now. The men promised me to be sensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his arm around her and then
turned&mdash;not to his aunt or his sister, but
to Vera.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make mother understand the
way I felt, won&rsquo;t you? I didn&rsquo;t confide in
you because I didn&rsquo;t want to get you into
my difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he saw the two police officers
approaching, with the railroad detective.</p>
<p>Billy smiled at them, although his face
was pretty white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are making a mistake in this. I
had a perfect right to give the strikers all
the information I ever gave them. As for
any trouble you have had along the road I
knew nothing about it until this minute.
And I doubt if you can prove the strikers
were mixed up in it anyway. Still I know
there is no use in my talking to you. I&rsquo;ll
have to tell my story to persons higher
in authority. I&rsquo;ll be ready to go along with
you in a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in ten minutes Billy had gone with
them, carrying a little bag packed with a
few of his belongings.</p>
<p>He looked very slender and young as he
walked away beside the heavy, older men.
But his head was up and his shoulders
squared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>If he had a lump in his throat and his
body shook with nervousness, he never
confessed the fact.</p>
<p>Instead, just before he was out of sight,
he turned and waved his hand gallantly to
the group of his Camp Fire friends.</p>
<p>Mrs. Webster had gone to her tent.
But the girls and Mrs. Burton received his
farewell in tears. Ralph Marshall felt that
he would like to have relieved himself of
his own emotion by using language which
was not permitted at Sunrise camp.</p>
<p>Before he was to return to his hotel,
however, in order to attend to some business
for Mrs. Burton, in connection with Billy&rsquo;s
arrest, Peggy Webster came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to thank you,&rdquo; she said
quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/pic4.jpg" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;I Just Wanted to Thank You,&rsquo; She Said.&rdquo;" width="400" height="701" />
<p class="center"><span class="sc">&ldquo;&lsquo;I Just Wanted to Thank You,&rsquo; She Said.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>But she held out her hand and, as Ralph
took it, he felt the clasp had its old, warm
friendliness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Grand Canyon</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I would give a great deal to be going
down into the Grand Canyon with
you today, Miss Ellen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Deal looked closely at her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to wish for
anything these days, because so much that
is good has already come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke seriously and was very much
in earnest; nevertheless her companion
laughed.</p>
<p>The young man and woman were standing
together at the summit of a cliff. Thousands
of feet below them lay the bottom of the
Grand Canyon, through which the Colorado
River runs for a distance of two hundred and
seventeen miles, with a world of adamant
and of radiant color lying between the
surface of the earth and this part of its
interior.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Near them were a dozen or more other
persons getting ready for the descent into
the canyon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are perfectly right, as you are apt
to be, Miss Ellen Deal,&rdquo; Robert Clark
returned. &ldquo;Fate has been kind to me
recently&mdash;kinder than I deserve. It is
wonderful that Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s husband is
to put on my new play. I sent it to him
before Marta and I had met any of her
Camp Fire party. But I suppose she did
bring me good luck in this as in another
thing, because it was hearing that the
famous Polly O&rsquo;Neill Burton was in this
neighborhood, which inspired me to offer
my play to her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Deal nodded vigorously, the already
bright color in her face growing brighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burton says she likes your play
immensely. She read the manuscript about
two weeks ago. And, of course, I am sorry
you can&rsquo;t go down into the canyon with
us. It is only my unfortunate way of
expressing myself. What I really meant
was that I am glad you are so much better
and have had such good fortune with your
writing. I don&rsquo;t feel nearly so worried
about you. We shall be going away from
here after a little, but I feel sure now that
you are going to get well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t stay on with Marta and
me when I have explained to you that I can
now afford to pay you for the care you will
give us? I know it isn&rsquo;t much to offer, but
I told you exactly what Mr. Burton had
given me as an advance royalty on my play.
Living simply, as we do out here, it ought
to last some time. Besides, who knows
what may happen, now my luck has
turned? Queer, isn&rsquo;t it, how bad fortune
often brings good? If I had kept on at
my newspaper job it might have been
a good many years before I had the
opportunity to write a play. Besides,
through being ill, haven&rsquo;t I come to
knowing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Deal blushed furiously and unbecomingly,
as she already had too much
color to make any more desirable. She
was one of the persons who have not the
faintest idea how to receive a compliment
gracefully. A compliment made her even
more curt and severe in her manner than
usual. And Robert Clark had a Southerner&rsquo;s
graceful fashion of being complimentary
to women in the most charming
and apparently sincere way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I would not stay with you
at any price when you no longer need me.
You were very much afraid of my offering
you charity when I volunteered to nurse
you until you were stronger. Now, that
you do not require the services of a nurse,
it seems you are offering charity to me.
It is totally unnecessary. Mrs. Burton
has asked me to continue to remain for a
time longer with the Camp Fire party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, unexpectedly, Ellen Deal&rsquo;s eyes
filled with tears.</p>
<p>How utterly ungracious and unattractive
her speech sounded! Nevertheless she
greatly wished Mr. Clark and his sister to
remember her with pleasure, when they
were so soon to be separated and probably
would not meet again.</p>
<p>But Robert Clark did not appear to be
either angry or hurt.</p>
<p>Instead, he continued looking at the
young woman beside him with a kind of
grave tenderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has it never occurred to you, Ellen,
that I may need and want you for other
reasons; that I may wish to care for you
more than I wish you to care for me? But
I have no right to speak of this to you now&mdash;not
until I am absolutely well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his thin, somewhat scholarly
hand and Ellen Deal put her own capable,
executive one into it. She did not understand
all her companion&rsquo;s speech implied, and
yet she had a flooding sense of happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A happy day to you; I must go now and
wish Mrs. Burton good luck. You are
wonderfully kind to have included Marta
in your excursion into the canyon. And
I have enjoyed my ride with you this far.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Camp Fire party had this morning
driven along a wonderful roadway which
is built beside the brink of the canyon
for a number of miles. They had finished
an early luncheon at an odd road house
imitating the Spanish style and furnished
with Spanish furniture.</p>
<p>At the present moment Mrs. Burton was
standing on the great porch of this hotel
talking to several of the Grand Canyon
guides and entirely surrounded by members
of her Camp Fire party. The others were
not far away, but outside in the hotel
grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Billy Webster was standing alongside
his aunt looking perfectly well and cheerful.
Two weeks had passed since his arrest, but
three days only had been required for
securing his release.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton had, of course, immediately
obtained the interest and the services of
several influential men, who promised to
get her nephew out of his difficulty as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Then Billy&rsquo;s own story had been perfectly
straightforward. He did not deny his
acquaintance with the strikers, but he did
assert that his effort with them had been
against their employing violence. There
was, also, Ralph Marshall&rsquo;s testimony that
his story was true. Also, there was Billy&rsquo;s
youth and his family&rsquo;s prominence to help
him. Whatever the reason or combination
of reasons, the boy&rsquo;s case was dismissed
after three days although there was still
the possibility that he might be called as a
witness at the trial of the suspected men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>However, Billy had apparently borne his
experience without much suffering in mind
or body. He had not looked so well or
animated, as he did today, since his arrival
in Arizona. He had also managed to make
peace with his family for his escapade,
which was more important. However, Mrs.
Burton insisted that he never be allowed
to get very far out of her own or her sister&rsquo;s
sight while they were in Arizona, so they
need have no further shocks through Billy&rsquo;s
proceedings.</p>
<p>The entire Camp Fire party, excepting
Mrs. Webster and Marie, who had wisely
remained at camp, was to descend on mule
back down one of the Grand Canyon
trails to a plateau above the Colorado River.
The trail was one of the easiest, nevertheless
it required thirty-six hours and they were
therefore to spend the night at a camp
midway down the incline.</p>
<p>Ralph Marshall, Terry Benton and
Howard Brent also were members of the
expedition and Robert Clark had taken the
drive, but was not strong enough to go all
the way down the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>There is an appalling grandeur and an
almost indescribable beauty in a descent
into the Grand Canyon. And the spectacle
affects persons very differently, according
to their temperaments. To some the
gigantic awfulness of this huge and mysterious
world of stone is more impressive
than its beauty or its majesty. To others
it appears as a divine monument of God,
revealing the mystery of creation rather
than inspiring terror.</p>
<p>But whatever the effect on the Camp Fire
party of the scene about them, as they
traveled slowly and carefully down the
steep path, getting deeper and deeper into
the center of the earth, they were more
silent and self-absorbed than ever before.
Even Sally Ashton and Gerry
Williams forgot to chatter, or else were
too much occupied with their efforts not
to come to grief, as the riding was extremely
difficult.</p>
<p>About sundown the rude little houses
built on a rocky plateau which were to be
their shelter for the night appeared as
havens of refuge to each of the travelers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>As soon as they could dismount, everybody
disappeared inside the houses to rest,
leaving only Peggy Webster and Ralph
Marshall outside in company with the
guides who were looking after the mules.
Peggy walked over to the edge of the cliff
and stood there looking down, and Ralph
waited a moment in order to be able to
speak to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been able to forgive myself,
Peggy, for clutching at you the afternoon
I tumbled over one of these cliffs,&rdquo; a voice
said unexpectedly at the girl&rsquo;s elbow. &ldquo;I
do many things I ought not, but I hate to
think of adding cowardice to my weaknesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph Marshall&rsquo;s face was so troubled
that Peggy involuntarily slipped her arm
inside his. Of course, one never forgets
an unkindness; it is hardly possible, but she
had in a measure forgiven Ralph for his
once careless attitude toward her. Moreover,
at present it made one feel safer and
happier to have the touch of something
human near one, while beholding so much
of nature in an unfriendly mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Ralph; your reaching
out was involuntary. Besides, you hardly
touched me. Anyone would have done
what you did without thinking. There was
no time, and I would not have fallen as you
hardly touched me, except that the ground
also gave way under my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good sport, Peggy, but it
scarcely needs me to tell you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peppy turned toward her companion with
one of her clearest and most straightforward
expressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to hear you say so though, Ralph,&rdquo;
she answered.</p>
<p>Then, in order to change the young man&rsquo;s
train of thought, she stared at the great
mountains of color up above them and then
at the deeper one at their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose life is as wonderful and
as beautiful a journey, Ralph, as the climb
through this canyon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph returned her gaze steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will be for you, Peggy, I wish
I were as certain for myself. But we shall
be reaching the end of the trail into the
canyon tomorrow. May I wish we may be
good friends to the end of a longer trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy had only time to answer, &ldquo;yes,&rdquo;
when Mrs. Burton, coming to the door,
called her into their little lodging for the
night.</p>
